<mark>**Stakeholders**</mark>: People who are insterested in and affected by the project's completion and success


## Exploring Project Team Roles and Responsibilities

### Accessibility for project managers

<mark>**Accessibility**</mark>: Actively removing any barriers that might prevent persons with disabilities from being able to access technology, information, or experiences, and leveling in the playing field so everyone has an equal chance of enjoying life and being successful.

### Choosing a project team

When identifying people resources, we need to carefully consider the project needs and use that info to guide our decision-making

{{< spoiler text="Required roles" >}}
The person in each role is accountable for specific tasks within the project life cycle.
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Team size" >}}
Vary greatly depending on the project size
- Complex projects with large divisions of work will usually require larger project teams. 
- Simple projects with straightforward expectations may only require a few people on the project team. As a project 

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Necessary skilles" >}}
Decide the right person for each role
  - It's on the project manager to ensure that everyone on the team has the right skills to do the job
  - It's also important to remember that skills can be taught
    - If a teammate doesn't have the necessary skills, it's important that they are trained in time so as not to cause project delays

Skills

- Technical skills: Skills specific to the task that needs to be performed
- Interpersonal skills (a.k.a. people skills, soft skills): Allows the team to blend their technical expertise with collaborative skills in order to get the job done
- Problem-solving skills: A must for all team members, especially when it comes to large, complex projects
- Leadership skills: Help team members navigate organizational boundaries and effectively communicate with stakeholders to generate buy-in. 

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Availability" >}}

- Value diversity early on when building your team

- Dedicate time early on in the team building process to develop trust between team members

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Motivation" >}}

- Take note of the motivation level of your team members and the impact it may have on your project
- As a project manager, it is your responsibility to engage your team and keep them motivated. Engaging in a respectful manner and maintaining a positive outlook with your team during times of adversity are simple ways to keep your team motivated. 

{{< /spoiler >}}


### Defining project roles

Clearly laying out the responsibilities for each role helps everyone know what project tasks they're accountable for.

Project roles we always have

{{< spoiler text="Project sponsors" >}}

The person who is accountable for the project and who ensures the project delivers the agreed upon value to the business.

- They play a vital leadership role throughout the process. 
- Sometimes they fund the project.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Team members" >}}

The people doing the work and making things happen.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Customers / Users" >}}

**Customers**: The people who will get some sort of value from a successfully landed project ("buyers of the project").

**Users**: The people that use the product produced by your project

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Stakeholders" >}}

Anyone involved in the project who have a vested interest in the project's success. 

- **Primary** stakeholders are people who expect to benefit *directly* from the project's completion, usually include team members, senior leaders, and customers
- **Secondary** stakeholders play an intermediary role and are *indirectly* impacted by the project, may be contractors or members of a partner organization.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Project manager" >}}

The person who plans, organizes and oversees the whole project.

- Responsible for the overall success of the team, and ultimately, the project as a whole
  - Understand that paying close attention to team dynamics is essential to successfully completing a project
  - Use team-building techniques, motivation, influencing, decision-making, and coaching skills, to keep teams strong. 
- Integrate all project work by developing the project management plan, directing the work, documenting reports, controlling change, and monitoring quality
- Responsible for balancing the scope, schedule, and cost of a project by managing engagement with stakeholders

## Evaluating Stakeholders

### Completing a stakeholder analysis

**Stakeholder analysis: a visual representation of all the stakeholders.** 

- It helps you avoid surprises, build necessary partnerships, and ensure you're involving the right people at the right time. 
- It helps you see all the opportunities for success and the potential risks.
- It illustrates which stakeholders are taking on which responsibilities, which can help you include the right people in important conversations and get support you need throughout the project.

#### Keys to kick off a stakeholder analysis

- Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
- Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
  - Influence: measures how much power a stakeholder has and how much the stakeholder's actions affect the project outcome
  - Interest: How much are the needs of the stakeholder affected by the project operations and outcomes
- Assess stakeholders' ability to participate and then find ways to involve them

#### Key steps of stakeholder analysis

1. Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts. 
   - Ask yourself: Who is invested in the project? Who is impacted by this project? Who contributes to this project? 
2. Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
   - The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 
3. Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them. 
   - **Active stakeholders**: with more opinions and touchpoints
   - **Passive stakeholders**: prefer only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day.

#### Techniques for managing stakeholders

Visualize the stakeholder analysis with a **power grid**:

![截屏2024-10-06 23.16.02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-10-06%2023.16.02.png)

- **Key players/stakeholders (top-right)**: closely partner with them to reach the desired outcomes
  - Have a significant influence on the project and are highly interested in its outcome
  - Can greatly impact project decisions and success.
  - Examples: project sponsors, key executives, or regulatory authorities.
  - Resposes for this quadrant
    - **Engagement and Involvement:**
      - Keep these stakeholders well-informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle.
      - Involve them in decision-making processes, seeking their input and feedback.
      - Address their concerns promptly and effectively.
    - **Regular Communication:**
      - Schedule regular meetings or updates to keep them informed about project progress and any issues.
      - Tailor communication to their preferences and needs to ensure they remain supportive and engaged.

- **Stakeholders with higher influence but lower interest** (top-left)
  - Consult with them and meet their needs. Their opinions and input are important to the project. (*e.g.*, The Director of Product has high influence, but may not be vested into day-to-day activities, and therefore will have a lower interest. )
  - Responses for this quadrant
    1. **Executive Summaries:**
       - Provide high-level summaries of project progress and key decisions for their review.
       - Focus on the impact of the project on organizational goals and objectives.
    2. **Periodic Updates:**
       - Provide periodic briefings or updates to ensure they are informed of major milestones and critical project changes.

- **Stakeholders with lower influence but high interest** (bottom-right)
  - Show consideration for them by keeping them up-to-date on the project. It's unlikely they'll need a say in what's going on, but keeping them informed is important. 
    - For example, the customer success team may have lower influence but high interest since they'll work directly with clients on the new product.

  - Responses for this quadrant
    1. **Regular Updates:**
       - Communicate project progress, risks, and updates to keep them engaged and informed.
       - Address their queries and concerns promptly to maintain their interest.
    2. **Stakeholder Feedback:**
       - Seek their feedback on project plans, progress, and outcomes to ensure their perspective is considered.

- **Stakeholders with low influence and low interest** (bottom-left)
  - Monitor them, keeping them in the know.
  - Responses for this quadrant
    1. **General Communication:**
       - Share general updates about the project's overall progress without overwhelming them with details.
       - Address any specific questions they may have, but avoid unnecessary inundation with project-related information.
    2. **Minimal Engagement:**
       - Maintain a basic level of communication and engagement to keep them aware of the project without distracting them from their regular responsibilities.


At the start of the project, list the stakeholders and then place them into the appropriate places on the grid. -> Being able to visualize their placement will help you manage communications and expectations. 

You may also want to create a **steering committee** made up of a high influence and high interest stakeholders.

- These people will be the most senior decision-making body on any project.
- They have the authority to make changes to budget and approve updates to timeline or scope.

#### Ways to involve each stakeholder

Be strategic to get helpful and relevant input from the right people at the right time

- Meet with some stakeholders every single day
- others you'll just send periodic updates to

#### Stakeholder buy-in

<mark>**Stakeholder buy-in**</mark>: The process of involving these people in decision-making to hopefully reach a broader consensus on the organization's future

To get stakeholders to buy-in on the project

- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder

- Pay particular attention to your high-impact stakeholders and make sure they feel looped in
- Explain to them how the project will help them achieve their goals
- Have their support later on if any issues come up
- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate.

Important things to keep in mind when communicating with stakeholders

- If you have one main stakeholder, that stakeholder is likely to be highly influential and needs constant communication.
- If you're on a larger project with numerous stakeholders, they won't be quite as involved in the day-to-day tasks.
- For stakeholders who need time to make decisions about the project, over-communicate early on
  - E.g., hold frequent meetings and send daily end-of-day progress emails. -> This way, they have enough time to weigh the options and make decisions. 
- Think about the level of project details each stakeholder needs. You don't want to spend time diving deep with stakeholders that just need a project summary.

{{< spoiler text="Suggested questions for stakeholders" >}}

- What are your most important priorities/goals?
- How will this initiative/project support you and your most important priorities?
- What role would you like to play within this initiative/project?
- Here’s how I plan to keep people informed; does that work for you?
- What can I clarify for you?
- What are your expectations? What would you like for the project to accomplish?
- What would success look like for you?
- Who else do you recommend I reach out to about this initiative?
- What information or insights do you have that might be challenging for me to find?
- Where do you see me getting support for this initiative? Facing resistance?
- What additional thoughts/questions do you have?

## Assigning Project Team Roles and Responsibilities 

### RACI chart

A **RACI** chart can be an extremely effective way to define project roles, give direction to each team member and stakeholder, and ensure work gets done efficiently. Having a RACI chart available throughout the duration of your project as a quick visual can be invaluable.

**RACI**

- **R**esponsible: Those doing the work to complete the task
- **A**ccountable: Those making sure the work gets done 
- **C**onsulted: Those giving input or feedback (e.g., subject matter experts or decision makers)
- **I**nformed: Those just needing to know the final decisions or that a task is done



![截屏2024-11-01 21.54.30](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-11-01%2021.54.30.png)

Steps for creating a RACI chart

0. Write down each task or deliverable for your project, and assign it the appropriate role for each stakeholder.

1. Think about who's involved in the project. Write the roles in a row across the top of the chart.

2. Write down the tasks or deliverables in a column on the left (not too specific here, keep the chart simple and easy to read)

3. Go through each task/deliverable and ask:

   - Who's responsible for doing this? 
   - Who's accountable if it doesn't get done? 
   - Who will have strong opinions to add, and therefore, should be consulted about how this gets done? 
   - Who needs to be informed of the progress or decisions made about this? 

   Assign the letters R, A, C, and I based on your answers.

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

As a project manager on Office Green's new service launch, one of your tasks is to create different price points for different packages and delivery frequencies. 

The Head of Finance will be ***accountable*** because the project needs to stay in budget and make money, but it's the Financial Analyst who's ***responsible***, as they're the person doing the work in determining optimal pricing. The Director of Product will be ***consulted*** on the matter as they oversee the product offerings. And finally, team members, like those on the sales team, need to be ***informed*** of the final pricing.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{% callout  note %}}

**Notice**

- It's possible there are several roles that fall into the "informed" and "consulted" categories.
- There will NEVER be more than one person designated as "accountable." This prevents confusion, because having one person accountable clearly defines ownership.
- The same person that is "accountable" may also be "responsible."

{{< spoiler text="Responsible" >}}

- Individuals who are assigned the “responsible” role for a task are the ones who are *actually* doing the work to complete the task. 
- Every task needs at least one responsible party. 
- It’s a best practice to try to limit the number of team members assigned to a task’s  responsible role, but in some cases, you may have more than one. 
- Ask yourself questions when determining which person or people should be placed in the responsible role for a given task

  - What department does the work fall under?
  - Who will perform the work?

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Accountable" >}}

- The “accountable” person is responsible for making sure the task gets done. 
- It is important to have **ONLY ONE** individual accountable for each task. -> This helps clarify ownership of the task. 
- The accountable person ultimately has the authority to approve the deliverable of the responsible party. 
- In order to determine who should be tagged as the accountable team member, consider:
  - Who will delegate the task to be completed?
  - Who will review the work to determine if the task is complete?
- You may encounter a situation where the responsible party is also accountable, but where possible, it is helpful to separate these roles. 
  - Ensuring that accountability is not shared ensures that there is no confusion on who the ownership belongs to.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Consulted" >}}

- Team members or stakeholders who are placed in the “consulted” role have useful information to help complete the task. 
- There is no maximum or minimum number of people who can be assigned a “consulted” role, but it’s important that each person has a reason for being there.
- A few ways you can help identify who is appropriate for the role:
  - Who will the task impact?
  - Who will have input or feedback for the responsible person to help the work be completed?
  - Who are the subject matter experts (SMEs) for the task?
- The consulted people will be in frequent, two-way communication with the responsible party, so it is key to make sure that the right people are in this role to help accomplish the task efficiently and correctly.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Informed" >}}

- Individuals who are identified as needing to be “informed” need to know the final decisions that were made and when a task is completed.
- It is common to have many people assigned to this category and for some team members to be informed on most tasks
- Make sure people who are in this group only require status updates and do not need to provide any direct feedback for the completion of the effort. 
- Key questions to ask yourself in order to ensure that you have appropriately captured individuals in the “informed” role are:
  - Who cares about this task’s completion?
  - Who will be affected by the outcome?

Example

As a project manager on Office Green's new service launch, one of your tasks is to create different price points for different packages and delivery frequencies. 

- the Financial Analyst will complete the work for this task. Therefore, we will list “Financial Analyst” in the *<u>responsible</u>* role for this task in the RACI chart.

- The Head of Finance has to make sure the project stays in budget and makes a profit, so they have the ultimate authority over the price points for the product. Therefore, they will need to approve the Financial Analyst’s work on the task (-> *<u>accountable</u>*). 

- After we’ve got a “responsible” Financial Analyst and an “accountable” Head of Finance, we need to think about

  - Who else would need to provide input on the product’s price points? 
  - Whose decisions and feedback will directly affect the task?

  The Director of Product will need to be <u>*consulted*</u> on the matter, as they oversee all product offerings. This person will have information about potential changes to the product and how these changes might affect price points.

- Your Financial Analyst has set the price points with input from the Director of Product, and the Head of Finance has approved. You will now need to *<u>inform</u>* the Sales Team about the final price points, as they will need this information to sell the product.
