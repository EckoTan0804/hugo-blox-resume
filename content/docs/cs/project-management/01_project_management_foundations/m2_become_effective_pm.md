## How a Project Manager Adds Value

### Value of a project manager

Project managers shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as guides for their team, using their impeccable organizational and interpersonal skills every step of the way. They add values to their teams including

- effective **prioritization** of tasks required to complete a project

- **delegation**: match tasks to individuals who can best complete the work

- effective communication with team and with key stakeholders
  
  > Stakeholders: People who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success, like the leader of an organization.

### How project manager impacts organizations

#### Focusing on the customer

- **Customer**: A person or an organization that defines the requirements of the project and sets important guidelines, such as budget and deadlines
  
   - Internal: stakeholders within your organization, such as management, project team members, resource managers, and other organizational departments
   
   - External: customers outside of your organization, such as clients, contractors, suppliers, and consumers.

- Project managers can add a lot of value to the project by **building relationships with customers** and **taking the time to make sure the customer is heard and satisfied with the result**.

- How to focus on the customer in a project: Sit with the customer and ask them questions like
  
   -  - **What is the problem you would like us to help solve?** 
        Example response: The customer wants help developing a new process that would allow their company to be more efficient.
      
      - **How is the problem impacting your organization?** 
        Example response: The customer states that they are losing clients because of their current inefficient processes since clients are sometimes receiving their orders late.
      
      - **What prompted you to ask for help now?** 
        Example response: The customer says that they may lose department funding if they do not improve efficiency. 
      
      - **What is your hope for the outcome of this project?** 
        Example response: The customer states that their ultimate goal is to increase the speed at which they fill orders without sacrificing quality.

Taking the time to dig a little deeper into the “why” behind the project can help a project manager better support and understand the customer. The more you understand the customer’s goals, the more likely you will be able to produce what the customer is seeking.

#### Building a great team

Project managers add value to the project by **identifying the right team for the project and enabling the team to be successful and make decisions**.

- Consider the skills needed for the project, as well as the resources available

- Understanding the customer’s requirements helps shape the skills needed for your team.

- Bring on people with the right skills and ensure the team knows that each individual is valued, trusted, and appreciated

- Demonstrate how you feel about the team’s value by allowing them to have input and ask questions, and by addressing their needs as soon as possible.

#### Fostering relationships and communication

- The project managers who add the most value are the ones who take the time to build relationships, communicate, and treat others with consideration and respect.

- Project managers can set the tone for a project and build relationships within their teams and with stakeholders. 
  
   - Taking the time to check in daily with your team, see how they’re doing, and ask if there is anything they need help with can go a long way towards making them feel valued and heard.

#### Managing the project

A successful project manager sees the impacts of each process within the project and communicates those impacts to the team. -> This ensures that everyone working on the project understands their task goal as well as the big picture goal for the finished product.

#### Breaking down barriers

A project manager adds value to a project when they break down barriers, allow their team to innovate new ways to do things, and empower them to share ideas.

- Provide support for your team as they try new approaches to find solutions

- Advocate for additional resources for your team

### Roles

A project manager is *not* often the direct manager of the people working on a project team. He is someone who manages the tasks of a project.

As a project manager, your job isn't to be the expert on everything. Instead you're responsible for **guiding your team** and **making sure that they have the support that they need in order to complete the project**.

- Hold all team members accountable for their assigned tasks
- Ensure that issues and risks are tracked and visible, and establish escalation paths

- Understand and help teammates adopt the right workflows and project management styles
- Collaborate with other teams at the organization to meet the requirements based on project, scope, schedule, and budget

### Working with cross-functional teams

A **cross-functional team** includes team members who have different backgrounds, types of expertise, and job functions. Even though these team members have different skill sets, occupy different roles, and may even work in different departments, they are all working towards a common goal: the successful completion of your project. 

Ideas of Working with cross-functional teams:

{{< spoiler text="Clarify goals" >}}

- Ensure that each member of the team understands their role, how they support each other, and the common goals of the project
  - Set clear goals for the team and make sure that the team understands those goals
  - Be direct and concise, avoiding extraneous details and explanations. 
- When communicating task or project goals, make sure you define key items, such as budget, deadlines, quality requirements, or important resources
- Ensure your team members understand task and project goals by encouraging them to ask questions and clarify information
- Continuously check in with your team to make sure they’re all moving towards their goals, staying on track, and completing quality work

{{< /spoiler >}}

### Leadership and team dynamics

Using your **interpersonal skills** is key to building relationships with the people involved in your project

- Learn about the need and concerns of the team
- Help you determine the priorities of the project and motivate your team throughout the process

This is called **influencing without authority** - a project manager's ability to guide teammates to complete their assigned work without acting as their direct managers.

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

Let's say you have a coworker who's constantly late to every meeting. While you can't force them to arrive on time, it's likely that you've thought about ways to motivate them to want to be on time. In doing so, you might have also wondered how to change the way you communicate with your coworker, to influence them to be on time. Maybe you've tried asking them to arrive 15 minutes earlier than the rest of the group or maybe you've told them how this behavior impacts the rest of the team. Both of these strategies are examples of influencing without authority, and they serve to encourage specific behavior.

{{< /spoiler >}}


Key interpersonal skills include 

{{< spoiler text="Communication" >}}

- Checking in with teammates to understand how they're progressing on a task
- Providing clear feedback on the quality of a teammate's work

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Negotiation" >}}

Negotiation might include working with a teammate to compromise on a new deadline when they tell you that they  won't be able to complete their work on time. This can be frustrating, but you'll need to use your negotiation skills often with your teammates and stakeholders to balance their needs and what is best for the project.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Conflict mediation" >}}

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Understanding motivations" >}}

- Getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to do their best work
- Learning how your teammates prefer to receive feedback, and how they like to receive recognition for doing a great job. Use that individualized information to motivate and encourage each person on your team.
