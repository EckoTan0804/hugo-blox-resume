## Understanding the Planning Phase Components

### Benefits of project planning

Planning 

- helps you map out the full project

- helps you understand the work needed to achieve your goals
- helps coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors, and vendors
- gives you time to identify and prepare for risks that could impact your project
- gives you the chance to brainstorm ways to mitigate or address those risks
- helps you get "buy-in" from key members of the project team
- demonstrates to stakeholders that the team is taking care to start the project with a detailed plan
- teamwork

### Launching the planning phase

Project plans don't have to be perfect the very first time. Even if you do a great job with your plans the first time around, it's likely that the plan will change as the project evolves.

Big things are worked out during this stage

{{< spoiler text="Schedule" >}}

- Project timeline, which includes the start date, the end date, and dates for events in between.

- Example

  > *Assume that you are the lead project manager for project Plant Pals, a new service that will provide top clients with desk-friendly plants. You want to launch the service by the end of the year, so the planning phase for this effort should include a number of key dates. Those dates might include when you'll request proposals from plant vendors. They might also include the date you'll kick off with the web designers and developers who are creating a new website for the service. It should also include important dates during the project execution phase, like when the plants need to be ready for delivery or when the new webpage design needs to be approved, and you'll need to include the target date for the launch of the service.*

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Budget" >}}

- Account for the total cost to complete the project.

  - Needs to be broken down to determine how much has to be spent on different elements of the project.

- Example

  > For project Plant Pals, the budget will need to include items like the cost of designing and launching a webpage, the cost of hiring your plant vendor, and much more.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Risk management plan" >}}

- Searching for possible problems and planning ahead to mitigate these risks

- You'll work with your team to consider answers to questions like

  - Where might the schedule get off track? 
  - Where might the budget exceed your estimates? 

  and prepare a risk management plan based on whatever you discover. 

- Example

  > *Let's go back to the Office Green example. While putting together the initial schedule, you may realize that your estimates from your developers put you way beyond your launch date. To manage that risk, you might try to reduce or adjust the project's scope to still meet your deadline or even negotiate a new launch date with your stakeholders.*

### Facilitating a project kick-off meeting

<mark>Project kick-off meeting</mark>: The first meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual roles within the team. 

#### Who should be invited?

- The team members identified in a [RACI chart]({{< relref "../02_project_initiation/m3_work_effectively_with_stakeholders.md/#raci-chart" >}}) chart, created during the initiation phase
  - During the kickoff meeting, team members will learn more about how they'll contribute to the project and how they'll gain a deeper understanding of how the team will work together to reach the project's goals. 
- Project stakeholders and sponsor (so that they have a chance to understand the high-level plan for the project, can share their perspective, and you can ensure that everyone is on the same page. ) 

#### Why is a kick-off meeting important?

- When you're kicking off a project, especially larger projects with multiple people involved, it's important to get together to establish a shared vision, align on the scope, and build team rapport
- An opportunity for teammates to ask questions and offer insights
- A great time for you to set expectations with the team about how each person will individually contribute to the project

#### How to plan a kick-off meeting? (Agenda)

1. Brief introductions (~ 10 mins)
   - Everyone in the group introduce themselves and their roles
   - If time allows, share a fun fact to help build team rapport
2. Project background  (~ 5 mins)
   - How the project came to be
   - Why the project matters
   - Set a shared vision
3. Goals and scope (~ 5 mins)
   - In-scope
   - Out-of-scope
   - Target launch date
   - Milestones
4. Roles (~ 5 mins)
   - Make sure that everyone is clear on what work they'll be responsible for throughout the duration of the project.
5. Collaboration (~ 10 mins)
   - Shared project tools and documents
   - Communication expectations
6. What comes next (~ 10 mins)
   - Set expectations with your teammates for what's coming up
7. Question round (~ 15 mins)
   - Gain clarity on meeting topics
   - Hear from the team and ensure that the project is benefiting from diversity of thoughts, experiences, and ideass

Feel free to schedule as much or as little time for each agenda item according to the needs of your project and the team

Once you've finalized the meeting agenda, document this information into a meeting agenda template, and send it to attendees a day or two ahead of the meeting. 

#### Best practivce

- **Set the right time.** 

  Choose a meeting time that works for everyone. Be mindful of time zone differences. 

- **Set the right length.** 

  Choose an appropriate meeting length—no more than one hour. You don’t want to waste people’s time, but you also don’t want to run out of time. Kick-off meetings work best when you first share key information and then spend any additional time on questions and team building.

- **Invite the right people.** 

  Be strategic about including the appropriate people. The goal is to invite attendees who play a role in the development and execution of the project, such as all team members, stakeholders, and the project sponsor. You don’t want to leave anyone out, but you also don’t want to invite people who shouldn’t be there.

- **Designate a notetaker.** 

  The discussion that takes place during the meeting is important. It is critical that you document any feedback, changes, or questions asked by attendees. If you are leading the meeting, designate someone else to take notes before the meeting starts. You can also use tools like Chorus Notetaker, Google Keep, Google Docs, or Microsoft OneNote. 

- **Set the agenda.** 

  To recap what we discussed in the video, a kick-off meeting agenda should generally include: introductions, the project background and purpose, project goals and scope, roles and responsibilities, the collaboration process and project tools, what comes next (expectations and action items), and time for questions and discussion.

- **Share the agenda**. 

  Prior to the meeting, share the agenda with attendees via email and identify speakers for each topic. By sending the agenda in advance, everyone will have an idea of what to expect, time to prepare for anything they may need to present or discuss, and time to generate questions or ideas.

- **Stick to the agenda**. 

  During meetings, discussions can sometimes go off topic or take longer than expected. As a project manager, it is your job to keep the meeting on track by redirecting discussions to the items on the agenda. 

- **Follow up after the meeting**. 

  After the meeting, make sure to send out a meeting summary featuring the meeting notes and any action items. In the follow-up email, also invite attendees to reach out if they have any additional questions.
