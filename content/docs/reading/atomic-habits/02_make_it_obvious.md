## The Man Who Didn't Look Right

The human brain is a prediction machine. 

- It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.
- Whenever you experience something repeatedly, your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.

‚Å†‚Å†With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes *without* consciously thinking about it.‚Å†‚Å† Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience.

Many actions run on autopilot; cues can trigger habits ***without*** conscious awareness.

Habits can be 

- Useful: You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. Or
- Dangerous: Your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what‚Äôs happening.

Behavior change starts with awareness: make the unconscious conscious.

### The habit scorecard

‚ÄúPointing-and-Calling‚Äù raises awareness and reduces errors by making automatic steps conscious.

{{< spoiler text="The 'Pointing-and-Calling' process of Japanese railway system" >}}

As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. 

- When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, ‚ÄúSignal is green.‚Äù 
- As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. 
- When it‚Äôs time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. 

Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. 

- Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, ‚ÄúAll clear!‚Äù Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.

This process, known as ‚Å†‚Å†**Pointing-and-Calling‚Å†**‚Å†, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is ‚Äúpoint-only,‚Äù and ‚Äúwithin two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.‚Äù

{{< /spoiler >}}

The more automatic a behavior becomes, the *less* likely we are to consciously think about it.

- When we‚Äôve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things - We assume that the next time will be just like the last. 
- We‚Äôre so used to doing what we‚Äôve always done that we don‚Äôt stop to question whether it‚Äôs the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.

Apply the "point-and-call" system with a **Habits Scorecard** to maintain awareness of what we are actually doing 

1. Make a list of your daily habits
2. Look at each behavior, ‚Å†‚Å†and ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?‚Äù Write +/-/= for good/bad/neutral habit, respectively.

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

- Wake up =
- Turn off alarm =
- Check my phone ‚Äì
- Go to the bathroom =
- Weigh myself +
- Take a shower +
- Brush my teeth +
- Floss my teeth +
- Put on deodorant +
- Hang up towel to dry =
- Get dressed =
- Make a cup of tea +

How to rate the habit?

- The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals.

- There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only **effective** habits - effective at solving problems.

  -> categorize your habits by how they will benefit you *in the long run*: good habits will have net positive outcomes, while bad habits have net negative outcomes.

- When you‚Äôre having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, ask yourself: ‚ÄúDoes this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?‚Äù

  - Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. 
  - Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

{{% /callout %}}

As the habit scorecard is created, there is NO need to change anything at first.

- Goal: Simply notice what is actually going on
- Observe your thoughts and actions ***without*** judgment or internal criticism

The process of behavior change always starts with **awareness**. The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.

- Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be.
  {{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

  If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to eat this cookie, but I don‚Äôt need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.‚Äù
  
  {{< /spoiler >}}

- Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real.
  - It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine.
  - Increases the odds that you‚Äôll actually do it. You‚Äôre getting yourself to acknowledge the need for action‚Äîand that can make all the difference.

**üí°Take Away**

- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.
- The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

## The Best Way to Start a New Habit

The two most common cues that can trigger a habit are: **time** and **location**.

**Implementation intentions**, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act, leverage both of these cues: ‚Å†*‚Å†‚ÄúWhen situation X arises, I will perform response Y.‚Äù‚Å†‚Å†* 

Studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals. People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.

- What people really lack is not motivation, is ***clarity*** - It is not always obvious when and where to take action.
- Once an implementation intention has been set, you don‚Äôt have to wait for inspiration to strike.

The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:

```
‚Å†‚Å†I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].‚Å†‚Å†
```

{{< spoiler text="Examples" >}}

- Meditation: I will <u>meditate</u> for one minute at <u>7 a.m.</u> in my <u>kitchen</u>.
- Studying: I will <u>study Spanish</u> for twenty minutes at <u>6 p.m.</u> in my <u>bedroom</u>.
- Exercise: I will <u>exercise</u> for one hour at <u>5 p.m.</u> in my <u>local gym</u>.
- Marriage: I will <u>make my partner a cup of tea</u> at <u>8 a.m.</u> in the <u>kitchen</u>.

{{< /spoiler >}}

If you aren‚Äôt sure when to start your habit, try the **first day** of the week, month, or year.

- People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher. 
- A fresh start feels motivating.

Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you **say no** to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course üôÖ.

üéØ **Goal: Make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can‚Äôt say why.**

### Habit stacking

An approach to use implementation intentions in your life and work is called **habit stacking**, identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. 

- No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior (**the Diderot Effect**).

- When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage.

Habit stacking is ‚Å†‚Å†a special form of an implementation intention.‚Å†‚Å† ‚Å†‚Å†Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a *current* habit.‚Å†

Formular:

```
‚ÄúAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].‚Äù
```

{{< spoiler text="Examples" >}}

- Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.
- Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes.
- Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I‚Äôm grateful for that happened today.
- Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss.
- Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family member where I am running and how long it will take.

{{< /spoiler >}}

**Key: Tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day.**

- Create larger stacks by chaining small habits together
- Build larger chains to leverage positive momentum. Take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next
  ![Êà™Â±è2025-09-19 22.01.05](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-09-19%2022.01.05.png)


{{< spoiler text="Example: Morning routine" >}}

1. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds.
2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day.
3. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first task.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Example: Evening routine" >}}

1. After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the dishwasher.
2. After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the counter.
3. After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for tomorrow morning.

{{< /spoiler >}}

You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current routines.

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}}
you may already have a morning routine that looks like this: 

1. Wake up
2. Make my bed  
3. Take a shower

Let‚Äôs say you want to develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expand your habit stack and try something like

1. Wake up
2. Make my bed  
3. ***Place a book on my pillow***
4. Take a shower

Now, when you climb into bed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy.

{{< /spoiler >}}

Habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide your future behavior. 

- It‚Äôs like you always have a game plan for which action should come next.

- Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate.
  {{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

  - Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using the elevator.
  - Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to someone I don‚Äôt know yet.
  - Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing.
  - Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies on my plate first.
  - Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away. (‚ÄúOne in, one out.‚Äù)
  - Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile before answering.
  - Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and chairs to make sure I don‚Äôt leave anything behind.

  {{< /spoiler >}}

The secret to creating a successful habit stack is **selecting the right cue to kick things off**.

- Habit stacking *implicitly* has the time and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference.
  - Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don‚Äôt ask yourself to do a habit when you‚Äôre likely to be occupied with something else.


- Your cue should also have the same **frequency** as your desired habit.

How to find the right trigger for your habit stack?

- Brainstorm a list of your current habits. Use your Habits Scorecard as a starting point. Or

- The two-columns method

  1. Create a list with two columns
  
  | Habits you do each day without fail                          | All of the things that happen to you each day without fail   |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | E.g.<br /><li/>Get out of bed. <li/>Take a shower. <li/>Brush your teeth. <li/>Get dressed. <li/>Brew a cup of coffee. <li/>Eat breakfast. <li/>Take the kids to school. <li/>Start the work day. <li/>Eat lunch. <li/>End the work day. <li/>Change out of work clothes. <li/>Sit down for dinner. <li/>Turn off the lights. <li/>Get into bed. | E.g. <br />  <li/>The sun rises. <li/>You get a text message. <li/>The song you are listening to ends. <li/>The sun sets. |
  
  2. Search for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle
  

Habit stacking works best when **the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable**.

- Be specific and clear. E.g. *After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table.*
- The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.

- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.
- The two most common cues are time and location.
- Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
- The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
