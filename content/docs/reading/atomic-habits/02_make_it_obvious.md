## The Man Who Didn't Look Right

The human brain is a prediction machine. 

- It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.
- Whenever you experience something repeatedly, your brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.

‚Å†‚Å†With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes *without* consciously thinking about it.‚Å†‚Å† Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience.

Many actions run on autopilot; cues can trigger habits ***without*** conscious awareness.

Habits can be 

- Useful: You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. Or
- Dangerous: Your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what‚Äôs happening.

Behavior change starts with awareness: make the unconscious conscious.

### The habit scorecard

‚ÄúPointing-and-Calling‚Äù raises awareness and reduces errors by making automatic steps conscious.

{{< spoiler text="The 'Pointing-and-Calling' process of Japanese railway system" >}}

As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. 

- When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, ‚ÄúSignal is green.‚Äù 
- As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. 
- When it‚Äôs time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. 

Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. 

- Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, ‚ÄúAll clear!‚Äù Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.

This process, known as ‚Å†‚Å†Pointing-and-Calling‚Å†‚Å†, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City adopted a modified version that is ‚Äúpoint-only,‚Äù and ‚Äúwithin two years of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57 percent.‚Äù

The more automatic a behavior becomes, the *less* likely we are to consciously think about it.

- When we‚Äôve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things - We assume that the next time will be just like the last. 
- We‚Äôre so used to doing what we‚Äôve always done that we don‚Äôt stop to question whether it‚Äôs the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.

Apply the "point-and-call" system with a **Habits Scorecard** to maintain awareness of what we are actually doing 

1. Make a list of your daily habits
2. Look at each behavior, ‚Å†‚Å†and ask yourself, ‚ÄúIs this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?‚Äù Write +/-/= for good/bad/neutral habit, respectively.

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

- Wake up =
- Turn off alarm =
- Check my phone ‚Äì
- Go to the bathroom =
- Weigh myself +
- Take a shower +
- Brush my teeth +
- Floss my teeth +
- Put on deodorant +
- Hang up towel to dry =
- Get dressed =
- Make a cup of tea +

How to rate the habit?

- The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals.

- There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only **effective** habits - effective at solving problems.

  -> categorize your habits by how they will benefit you *in the long run*: good habits will have net positive outcomes, while bad habits have net negative outcomes.

- When you‚Äôre having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, ask yourself: ‚ÄúDoes this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?‚Äù

  - Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. 
  - Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

As the habit scorecard is created, there is NO need to change anything at first.

- Goal: Simply notice what is actually going on
- Observe your thoughts and actions ***without*** judgment or internal criticism

The process of behavior change always starts with **awareness**. The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.

- Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be.
  {{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

  If you want to cut back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another cookie, say out loud, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to eat this cookie, but I don‚Äôt need it. Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.‚Äù

- Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real.
  - It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine.
  - Increases the odds that you‚Äôll actually do it. You‚Äôre getting yourself to acknowledge the need for action‚Äîand that can make all the difference.

**üí°Take Away**

- With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
- Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.
- The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
