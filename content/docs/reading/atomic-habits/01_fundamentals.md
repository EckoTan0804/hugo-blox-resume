## The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

### Why small habits make a big difference

It is so easy to *overestimate* the importance of one defining moment and *underestimate* the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. 

- Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. We put pressure on ourselves to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.
- Improving by 1 % isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even *noticeable*—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding.
  ![截屏2025-09-02 19.59.55](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-09-02%2019.59.55.png)

Habits are the **compound interest** of self-improvement. The effects of your habits *multiply* as you *repeat* them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.

We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment.

- We make a few improvements, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous routines.

  - E.g., *If you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language.*

- Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide!

  - E.g., *If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time to finish it later.*

  <span style="color: #d65d48;">When we repeat 1% errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results!!!</span>

Making a choice that is 1% better or 1% worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. **Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.**

It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. **What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.** 

- If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Outcomes lag behind habits.
- Time amplifies whatever you feed it: good habits make time an ally; bad habits make time an enemy.

### Your habits can compound for you or against you

| Positive Compounding                                         | Negative Compounding                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Productivity compounds.**<br />The effect of automating an old task or mastering a new skill can be even greater. The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. | **Stress compounds.**                                        |
| **Knowledge compounds**.<br /><li/>Learning one new idea won’t make you a genius, but a commitment to lifelong learning can be transformative.<li/>Each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. | **Negative thoughts compound.**<br />The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. |
| **Relationships compound.**<br />People reflect your behavior back to you. The more you help others, the more others want to help you. Being a little bit nicer in each interaction can result in a network of broad and strong connections over time. | **Outrage compounds.**<br />A long series of microaggressions and daily aggravations slowly multiply until one event tips the scales and outrage spreads like wildfire. |

### What progress is really like

**Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.**

Similarly, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance.

![截屏2025-09-02 21.27.02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-09-02%2021.27.02.png)

- In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a **Valley of Disappointment**.
  - You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it’s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days, weeks, and even months.
  - It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: **the most powerful outcomes are delayed.**
  - This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—the ***Plateau of Latent Potential***.
- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.
- When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.
  - The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. 
  - But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren’t making any progress—that makes the jump today possible.
  - Mastery requires patience: steady, repeated effort before any crack appears.


{{< spoiler text="Example: Ice melting analogy" >}}
Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.
Twenty-six degrees.
Twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight.
The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.
Twenty-nine degrees.
Thirty.
Thirty-one.
Still, nothing has happened.
Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.

### Forget about goals, focus on systems instead

Difference between goals and systems: Goals are about the **results** you want to achieve; systems are about the **processes** that lead to those results.

{{< spoiler text="Examples" >}}

- If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.
- If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.
- If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.

{{< /spoiler >}}

Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems:

{{< spoiler text="Winners and losers have the same goals." >}}

- Winners and losers typically share the same goals, so goals don’t explain outcomes.
- Survivorship bias makes us credit success to goals while ignoring those with identical goals who failed.
- The goal had always been there. The real differentiator is the system: consistent, continuous small improvements lead to success.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Achieving a goal is only a ⁠⁠momentary⁠⁠ change" >}}

- Hitting a goal creates only a temporary improvement.
- Without changing the underlying habits/system, the old problem returns (You treated a symptom <u>without</u> addressing the cause.⁠⁠).
- We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the **systems that cause those results.** 
  - When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them *temporarily*. 
  - In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Goals restrict your happiness." >}}

- The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” -> A goals-first mindset postpones happiness until a milestone is hit, 
- Goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. -> You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. 
  - Real life rarely matches a single planned outcome, so tying happiness to one result is misguided.
- A systems-first mentality provides the antidote: ⁠⁠When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. **You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.⁠⁠**

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Goals are at odds with long-term progress." >}}

- A goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect.
  - When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.
- ⁠⁠The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.⁠
- ⁠True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. 
  - It’s not about any single accomplishment. 
  - It is about **the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.** Ultimately, it is your commitment to the *process* that will determine your *progress*.⁠⁠

{{< /spoiler >}}

### A system of atomic habits

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. ⁠⁠The problem is your system. 

- Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.⁠⁠

- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

-> ⁠⁠**Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal⁠⁠!** 

“Atomic habits” are small, 1% improvements that are parts of a larger system—like atoms to molecules. They are simple yet powerful building blocks of compound growth and overall improvement.

{{% callout note %}}

**💡Take Away**

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.
- Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.
- An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.

## How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.

The first reason why changing our habits is so challenging is that **<span style="color: #d65d48;">we try to change the wrong thing</span>**.

There are three levels at which change can occur:

![截屏2025-09-03 22.57.35](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-09-03%2022.57.35.png)

| Layer | Changing                   | Note                                                         |                    |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1     | **Changing your outcome**  | This level is concerned with changing your **results**: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change. | *What you get*     |
| 2     | **Changing your process**  | This level is concerned with changing your **habits and systems**: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level.s | *What you do*      |
| 3     | **Changing your identity** | This level is concerned with changing your **beliefs**: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level. | *What you believe* |

When it comes to building habits that last, the problem is not that one level is “better” or “worse” than another - all levels of change are useful in their own way. <span style="color: #d65d48;">The problem is the ***direction* of change**: Most people focus on outcomes (goals), which leads to **outcome-based habits**</span>.

A more durable approach is **identity-based habits**: Instead of focusing on "What do I want to achieve?" (the result/outcome/goal),  begin with focusing on **“Who do I want to become?”** (the identity).

Lasting habit change requires identity change, not just behavior tweaks.

- E.g.: “I’m not a smoker” (identity) beats “I’m trying to quit smoking” (behavioral attempt).

- People often over-focus on outcomes/processes and ignore belief systems that drive actions. Their old identity can ⁠⁠sabotage⁠⁠ their new plans for change.

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.

- Behavior that is ⁠⁠incongruent⁠⁠ with the self will not last. 
- ⁠It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. 

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when **a habit becomes part of your identity**.

- Pride reinforces maintenance: The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. 💪

- ⁠⁠True behavior change is identity change.⁠⁠ ⁠⁠You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.⁠

  | The goal is not to... | The goal is to... |
  | --------------------- | ----------------- |
  | Read a book           | Become a reader   |
  | Run a marathon        | Become a runner   |
  | Learn an instrument   | Become a muscian  |

Your behaviors are usually a *reflection* of your identity. 

- What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously.
  - E.g., the person who incorporates exercise into their identity doesn’t have to convince themselves to train.
- When your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

Identity is a *double-edged* sword - It can powerfully sustain good habits or <span style="color: #d65d48;">rigidly block change</span>.

- Self-labels repeated over time (like “I’m not a morning person,” “I’m bad at math,” etc.) become mental grooves that guide behavior and resist new actions.
  - In time, you begin to resist certain actions because “that’s not who I am.” There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.

- The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.
  - The biggest barrier to positive change is **identity conflict** - Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

->  ⁠⁠Over the long run, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way.⁠ 😤

Progress requires **unlearning**.⁠ ⁠⁠⁠Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to **continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity**.

### The two-step process to changing your identity

Identity is learned and shaped by experience. Your habits are *how you ⁠⁠embody⁠⁠ your identity*.

- The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.”
- E.g.: When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.

Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have **proof** of it.

- ⁠The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it.⁠⁠
- Every action is an evidence. As you repeat thess actions, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change.
  - The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away.
  - The effect of habits gets reinforced with time -> By virtue of their frequency your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. 

Habits are the path to changing your identity⁠⁠. ⁠⁠The most practical way to change who you are is to change *what you do*.⁠⁠

- The process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.⁠⁠ This is a gradual evolution.
  -  We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. ⁠
  - We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.
- Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity.
  - Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.
- You don’t need perfection—just a majority of “votes” for the desired identity.

#### Two step process

{{< spoiler text="1. Decide the type of person you want to be." >}}

If unclear, start from desired results and work backward, ask yourself: “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?”

- E.g., *Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a new language?*


{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.⁠" >}}

- ⁠Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity.⁠

- Acting like the desired person—even in tiny ways—gradually makes you that person.


{{< /spoiler >}}

### Habits ↔ identity feedback loop

Habits shape identity, identity shapes habits.

It’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on **becoming that type of person**, not getting a particular outcome.

### The real reason habits matter

Identity change is the North Star of habit change.

- ⁠The first step is not what or how, but **who**. You need to know who you want to be. 
- Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder.⁠⁠

You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself.

- Your identity is not set in stone. 
- You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today.

Better habits aren’t about life hacks or external metrics but about becoming a certain kind of person

- Over time, your habits shape your deepest self-beliefs—you become your habits.

**💡Take Away**

- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.
