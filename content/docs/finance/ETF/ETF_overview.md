## What is ETF?

An <mark>**ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)**</mark> is an **exchange-traded index fund**, which combine three important concepts (fund, index investment and exchange-traded) in one product.

{{< spoiler text="Fund" >}}
- A strictly regulated financial product that pools money from investors and invests it in the capital markets according to a predefined investment objective
- Through a single investment, it is very easy to participate in the performance of a basket of securities. Because the invested **money is divided among several securities**, the risk of the investment is also spread (**diversification**).
- Since price increases and decreases of individual securities can balance each other out, the value of a fund usually fluctuates ***less*** than the value of an individual security.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Index fund" >}}

- A fund, whose objective is to **replicate a rule based index as closely as possible** (for example, share indices such as the S&P 500, DAX or MSCI World). 
- An **index** represents a basket of several securities. If the prices of the securities in an index rise, the value of the index fund also rises. If they fall, the value of the index fund falls accordingly.
- Unlike actively managed funds, with ETFs it is not individuals who make the investment decisions. Instead, the composition of the index determines which securities the ETF invests in and with which weighting. Since <u>no</u> fund management has to be paid for the analysis of the individual securities, the **ongoing costs of index funds are usually significantly <u>lower</u>** than those of active funds.

An index tracks and measures the performance of a group of assets representing a specific segment of the market.

{{< spoiler text="Exchange trading" >}}

- ETFs are index funds that can be **bought or sold on stock exchanges**.
- A stock exchange listing also has the advantage that prices are continuously quoted during trading hours so investors can transparently follow price movements. This contrasts with actively managed funds that are not listed on stock exchanges, which can usually only be traded once a day directly with the investment company. 
- There are no entry fees for exchange trading.

{{< /spoiler >}}

An ETF is a **basket of investments** like stocks or bonds that trades on the stock market.

## How can ETFs be used for investing?

ETFs are the ideal product to invest **savings into the capital markets over the medium to long term**.

- ETFs provide very uncomplicated access to a broadly diversified portfolio.
- ETFs greatly simplify essential questions concerning the selection of individual securities and their weighting within a portfolio.

### From the individual ETF to the ETF portfolio

ETFs can be used to invest into numerous 

- **asset classes**: [shares](https://de.scalable.capital/en/finance/shares-explained), [bonds](https://de.scalable.capital/en/finance/bonds-explained) and commodities
- **market segments**: such as countries, sectors, or themes

By combining several ETFs, a personalised **portfolio** can be created at a very low cost. ETFs on very broad indices in particular are suitable as the **basis or core for a long-term portfolio**

The **size** of the individual positions in an ETF depends on the weighting method of the index being tracked. Most indices are **weighted by market capitalisation**. 

- The more market capitalisation a company has, the higher its weighting in the index and, therefore, also in the ETF. 

  -> This can lead to a situation where a few individual stocks in the ETF are responsible for the majority of the performance.

Popular equity ETFs on the market that do *<u>not</u>* weight companies by market capitalisation and/or that enable investments with a special focus:

{{< spoiler text="Sustainable ETFs" >}}

- Consider sustainability aspects in their composition. Sustainability is usually measured in the three dimensions of **environmental, social and governance (ESG)**
- Investors should look closely at how well the ESG criteria applied correspond to their own ideas of sustainability. 
- Sustainable ETFs are often identified by name suffixes such as "ESG" or "SRI" (socially responsible investing).

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Regional and country ETFs" >}}

- Invest **regionally**, depending on where the included companies are headquartered or have their home stock exchange.
- However, since large companies typically sell their products globally, one is usually also exposed to the opportunities and risks of other markets.
- Example: An ETF on the DAX
  - A DAX ETF tracks the performance of the 40 stocks from the German Share Index. 
  - The individual shares have the *same* weighting in the ETF as in the index. Due to the strong focus on German export-oriented companies, the index and thus ETFs on it tend to be less diversified than ETFs based on indices with significantly more shares from several countries and a broader mix of sectors.


{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Sector and thematic ETFs" >}}

- Usually invest with a higher concentration in **sector**s, such as information technology, industry or health

- Thematic ETFs invest in companies that operate around a theme such as renewable energy or ageing society (i.e. away from the classic sector classification).
- Example: An ETF on the Nasdaq 100

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Factor ETFs" >}}

- Constructed according to the findings of various investment studies
  - These studies state that with focus on certain factors, an excess return can be achieved versus the broad market
- However, this need not be the case in all market cycles. 
- Well-proven factors include small caps (shares of companies with low market capitalisation), value (low-valued shares), and minimum volatility (shares with comparatively low price fluctuations).

{{< /spoiler >}}

#### Specialized ETFs 

{{< spoiler text="Depending on the structure of the ETF portfolio, ETFs with a special focus can be a useful component" >}}

- Special attention should be paid to the **mix of asset classes** when creating a portfolio.
  - Depending on the individual risk-bearing capacity and investment horizon, different allocations are suitable, such as with equity and bond ETFs (for example 70 percent equities, 30 percent bonds). Compared to equities, bonds are generally less susceptible to fluctuations and ensure greater stability of the portfolio (with lower expected returns over a long investment period). 
  - ETFs on other asset classes such as commodities can be added.

- Advanced investors sometimes use a **core-satellite strategy** to customise their investment. 

  - **Core**: A broadly diversified basic investment, which makes up the majority of the portfolio
  - **Satellites**: ETFs with a special investment focus are added (around the core) with a lower weighting 

{{< /spoiler >}}

With intelligent additions, investors can diversify their ETF portfolio more broadly or give it an individual touch. In doing so, they should be careful **not to unintentionally create cluster risks**. 

- For example, an ETF on the MSCI World already contains the companies from a Nasdaq 100 ETF. Putting both products in the portfolio does not diversify, but creates a stronger focus on US technology stocks. 

From a risk perspective, **the more specialised an ETF is** - for example, a country ETF on a very small equity market or an ETF on a niche theme - the more it should be considered as a small **addition to the portfolio** in addition to ETFs on the broad equity market. 

- Beginners in particular should focus (initially) on market-wide ETFs in order to avoid unintended concentration risks of individual sectors or regions in the portfolio!

## ETF selection: What criteria to look for

{{< spoiler text="Tracking method" >}}

An ETF tries to replicate its index as best as possible. In terms of replication methods, a distinction is made between physical and synthetic replication.

- **Full physical replication**
  - Investments are made directly in all the securities contained in the index. This is sometimes difficult to do for large international indices with many thousands of securities.
  - For reasons of efficiency, fund companies therefore often use "optimised sampling": The ETF invests only in those securities that best represent the performance of the index. Securities that are too small or illiquid are avoided. This saves the fund unnecessary costs and risks.
- **Synthetically replication**
  - Do not invest directly in the securities contained in the index, but enter into an **exchange transaction ("swap")** with a large investment bank.
    - The ETF receives the performance of the underlying index
    - In return, the investment bank deposits collateral should it become insolvent. 
  - Depending on the asset class and market segment, synthetic ETFs can have advantages. For example, synthetic ETFs on US equities have tax advantages that can lead to better performance. 
  - Due to strict regulation and full collateralisation, synthetic ETFs are considered <u>as safe as</u> physical ETFs.
- **[hybrid replication](https://de.scalable.capital/en/financial-terms-glossary/hybrid-replicating-etfs)**
  - A combination of physical and synthetical replications
  -  ETFs with physical and synthetic replication are selected in order to combine the advantages of both in the best possible way. (This is the case for the [Scalable MSCI AC World Xtrackers (Acc).](https://de.scalable.capital/en/scalable-world-etf))

Comparison

| **Replication Method** | **Definition**                                               | **Advantages**                                | **Disadvantages**                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Physical**           | Directly holds the constituent securities of the index       | Transparent, simple                           | Can have higher costs, limited by market liquidity |
| **Synthetic**          | Uses derivatives (such as swaps) to replicate the index's performance | Low cost, suitable for hard-to-access markets | Credit risk, lower transparency                    |
| **Hybrid**             | Combines physical holdings and derivatives to replicate the index | Flexible, covers a broader range of assets    | More complex, possibly higher fees                 |

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Use of income" >}}

- **Distributing** ETFs (Dist)
  - Dividends are paid out to your cash account at regular intervals (annually, semi-annually, quarterly or even monthly)
  - Often marked with a "Dist" or "D"
- **Accumulating ETFs** (Acc)
  - **Re**invest current income in securities *automatically*. -> This allows investors to benefit from the <u>*compound interest*</u> effect and they do not have to reinvest dividends manually.
  - Usually marked with an "Acc" or "C" in the name

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Costs" >}}

<mark>**Total Expense Ratio (TER)**</mark>: The ongoing annual cost, which is taken as a percentage of the investment volume.

- These account for 

  - management fees of the fund company

  - Licensing costs for the use of the index 

  - Custodian bank fees for the safekeeping of the securities contained in the ETF

- Not included are transaction costs for reallocations within the fund or costs for hedging foreign currency risks, if this is done.
- Deducted directly from the fund assets and is already included in the market prices.

<mark>**Tracking difference**</mark>: The performance of an ETF may deviate (slightly) from the performance of its index due to the ongoing costs, taxes at the fund level, and the imperfect replication of the index. It is measured over a certain time interval and is shown on the issuer's website or in the ETF's factsheet.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Fund volume" >}}

- Provides information about the size of the fund. 
  - From a fund volume of approx. 100 million euros, it can be assumed that the ETF can be operated economically by the issuer in the long term.
  - For ETFs with a higher TER (such as thematic ETFs), this threshold can also be lower.
- Should an ETF be closed due to lower popularity, this is usually not a problem, as investors are able to sell their units via the stock exchange before closure.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Fund domicile" >}}

- Refers to the **country** in which the fund is launched.
- Many ETFs are domiciled in Luxembourg (because of its favourable financial legislation) or Ireland (because of partial tax advantages for issuers).
- As funds are strictly regulated financial products, domicile is usually irrelevant. 
  - However, there may be differences in certain situations. For example, physical ETFs domiciled in Ireland on US equities pay lower withholding taxes (15 per cent) than ETFs domiciled in Luxembourg (30 per cent), which can lead to better performance.

## Advantages of ETFs

{{< spoiler text="ETFs are diverse and have low costs." >}}

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="ETFs reliably track the market." >}}

- Allow investors to invest in an entire market segment with a single investment.
- The selection of individual securities as in active fund management is dispensed with. -> The market return can be generated very reliably. The investment does not depend on whether a fund manager outperforms the market (also called "alpha"). (Studies show that the vast majority of active fund managers fail to beat their respective passive benchmark over time.)

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="ETFs are transparent." >}}

- It is possible to invest in numerous securities at the same time. 
- The composition can be viewed on the issuers' website on a daily basis. Due to the rule-based structure of the index, there are no surprises.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="ETFs are regularly rebalanced." >}}

- The issuer takes care of the regular rebalancing of the securities within the ETF. -> An active adjustment of one's own investment is not necessary.
- Regular rebalancing ensures that the components of a (physical) ETF always correspond to the underlying index and thus to the relevant market.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="ETFs are safe." >}}

- Capital invested in funds and ETFs is described as special assets. The assets are kept <u>separate</u> from the fund's administrator, the fund company, and are protected from insolvency.
- An auditor inspects the fund's books at least once a year.

## How to Analyze ETFs?

After you find the ETF that you're interested in, you need to first look at its **profile** (simply Google the name of the ETF).

## Diversification

### Fund Overlap

- Reduce the benefits of diversification for investors and may create unseen risks 🙁 

- Example: 99.4% of the stocks in [VOO](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo) are also in [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti).

### Portfolio correlation

**Correlation**: A measure that shows how prices of two securities move in relation to each other (i.e., if one goes up or down, does the other also go up or down)

- Measured by **[Correlation Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_coefficient)** $\in [-1, 1]$, a statistic that indicates the degree to which two securities move in relation to each other

| Correlation | Correlation coefficient                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Positive    | ![截屏2025-03-01 23.27.46](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-03-01%2023.27.46.png) |
| Negative    | ![截屏2025-03-01 23.29.04](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-03-01%2023.29.04.png) |

To maximize the diversification, we should include assets that are less correlated

![截屏2025-03-01 23.34.26](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-03-01%2023.34.26.png)

- Stocks
- Bonds
- Real Estate
- Commodities
- Cash equivalents

You should NOT invest in assets that have a negative correlation with one another. Because one goes up, while the other goes down, those two movements may cancel out any money you make (assuming they are weighted equally).
