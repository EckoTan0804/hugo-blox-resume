## ðŸ’¡Take Away
- The stocks contained in ETFs pay dividends, which you, as an investor, benefit from.
- Distributing ETFs pay out the dividends to your account.
- Accumulating ETFs reinvest the dividends, meaning they buy more shares.
- For passive income, distributing ETFs are suitable. If you want to build wealth, accumulating ETFs are more beneficial.
- For most indices, ETFs are available in both variants.

## What happens to dividends in ETFs?

Companies can share their profits with shareholders by distributing dividends. Shareholders receive a certain amount of money based on the number of shares they own.

An ETF consists of thousands of individual stocks. When a company pays dividends to an ETF, these dividends belong to the ETF investors. An ETF can handle these earnings in two ways:

- **Distributing ETFs:** The ETF <u>pays out</u> the dividends to its investors. Depending on the ETF, investors receive payments annually, quarterly, or even monthly.
- **Accumulating ETFs:** The ETF <u>reinvests</u> the dividends by purchasing more shares. This increases the fund's total assets (fund volume). This process is known as **accumulation (thesaurierung)**.

## Distributing ETFs: Dividends Paid to Your Account

Distributing ETFs *regularly* pay out their earnings directly to your settlement account. -> You have full control over how to use this moneyâ€”you can either reinvest it or spend it elsewhere. If you choose to reinvest the dividends, transaction costs may apply.

For investors using German brokers, taxes on earnings from distributing ETFs are *automatically* deducted, making the process convenient. However, if your broker is based abroad, you must report these distributions in your tax return.

Because of their regular payouts, distributing ETFs are ideal for generating **passive income**. 

- You can treat these payments like a salary from employment. 
- They are especially popular among older investors, who often use them as a form of **retirement income**.

## Accumulating ETFs: Dividends Are Reinvested

The key advantage of accumulating ETFs is that you, as an investor, benefit from the **compound interest effect**. 

- Earnings, such as interest and dividends, are automatically reinvested into the ETF. 
- As the ETF's value grows, so does the value of your ETF shares. This means you also earn returns on the reinvested dividends, allowing your money to work for you and generate long-term returns. 
- The longer your money remains in a profitable accumulating ETF, the greater the **compound growth effect**.

Since you do not receive cash payouts from accumulating ETFs, you do not *immediately* realize taxable gains. The overall tax burden during the accumulation phase remains **significantly lower** compared to distributing ETFs, as taxation is initially minimized.

A Simplified example (with considering tax) to compare distributing and accumulating ETF:

|                          | **Distributing ETF**          | **Accumulating ETF**  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **ETF Price**            | â‚¬100                          | â‚¬100                  |
| **Dividend Received**    | â‚¬5                            | â‚¬5                    |
| **Paid to Your Account** | â‚¬5                            | â‚¬0 (Reinvested)       |
| **New ETF Price**        | â‚¬100                          | â‚¬105                  |
| **Total Wealth**         | **â‚¬105** (â‚¬100 ETF + â‚¬5 cash) | **â‚¬105** (all in ETF) |

## Which is better?

- If you **want to build wealth**, an **accumulating ETF** is the better choice. Over the years, you benefit from **compound interest**, which can significantly boost your returns. Additionally, you save on transaction costs that might occur if you manually reinvest dividends.
- If you **want passive income**, a **distributing ETF** is more suitable. You receive regular cash flow, but to generate enough income to live on, you need to invest a large amount.
  - With a distributing ETF, you can also make better use of the **â‚¬1,000 annual tax-free allowance**, as you receive dividends directly.

### Accumulating vs. Distributing ETFs

|                       | **Accumulating**                                  | **Distributing**                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Use of earnings**   | Earnings are automatically reinvested in the ETF  | Earnings are paid out; some providers offer automatic reinvestment |
| **Compound interest** | Yes                                               | Optional (only with reinvestment)                            |
| **Taxation**          | Advance lump sum plus capital gains tax upon sale | Tax allowance on earnings is considered by the broker; capital gains tax on each distribution as well as upon sale |
