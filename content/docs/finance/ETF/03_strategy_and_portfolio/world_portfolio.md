## ðŸ’¡ Take Away

- The world portfolio is based on various financial theories, such as the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** and the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**.

- For private investors, globally diversified index funds are suitable. These aim to represent the global economy while minimizing risk through broad diversification.

- Financial professionals develop different implementations of the world portfolio, such as the ARERO World Fund and Multi-Factor Investing.

## Theoretical Background

By combining some of the financial theories, the foundation is created for the rationale behind investing in a world portfolio.

### Markets Are Efficient

**Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**: **efficient markets reflect all available information in their prices**

- If we assume that markets are efficient, then a stock has a value of **X** because it accurately reflects all relevant information.
- As a result, **it is impossible for an individual investor to consistently outperform the market in the long run**.
  - This means that **market forecasts published by analysts are ultimately irrelevant**.

### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

- This model focuses on **pricing in financial markets**, specifically the relationship between **expected return and expected risk**.

  > *The higher the risk, the higher the return.*

- It has proven useful for private investors, which is why it serves as a theoretical foundation for investing in a world portfolio.

## Why a World Portfolio?

To minimize risk, there is one key tool: **diversification**.

- The **maximum level of diversification** is achieved by investing in **everything available** (which is why the term *"world"* is used in *"world portfolio."*)
- While no world index can truly capture everything, it provides broad exposure at low costs.

Diversifying

- **avoid individual company risk**, which is inherent in **stock picking** (selecting individual stocks)
- minimize regional risk, helps eliminate the so-called **"home bias"**â€”a psychological tendency where investors prefer to invest in companies from their home country.

With a **buy-and-hold strategy**, you avoid the **gambling-like nature of market timing**. Successfully predicting the best times to enter and exit the market is extremely difficult. By holding your investments for the long term, you eliminate the reliance on luck.

## How Is the World Portfolio Implemented?

Different people implement the **world portfolio** concept in different ways.

{{< spoiler text="ARERO World Fund" >}}

- ARERO: **"Aktien â€“ Renten â€“ Rohstoffe"** (*stocks â€“ bonds â€“ commodities*)
- The fund allocates **60% to global stocks**, **25% to European bonds**, and **15% to commodities**.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Gerd Kommer's Approach" >}}

- Combines **global investing with multi-factor investing**
- Aims to integrate multiple **return-enhancing factors**, such as small-cap stocks and value stocks

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="DIY World Portfolio with ETFs" >}}

- An **MSCI ACWI-based ETF** covers **a large portion of the global economy**.
- A **70/30 portfolio** splits investments between a **global index** and an **emerging markets index**.

{{% callout  warning %}}
The variety of world portfolio strategies exists because it is impossible to fully replicate the entire global economy. Every version focuses on certain aspects while leaving others out. Therefore, choosing a specific world portfolio variant is more a matter of personal preference rather than a strict theoretical difference.
