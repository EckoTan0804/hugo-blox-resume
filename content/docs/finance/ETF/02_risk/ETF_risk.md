## ðŸ’¡ Take Away

- You can't completely avoid risk when investingâ€”returns are the reward for taking that risk. 
- **Market risk** affects all investments and refers to stock market fluctuations (**volatility**).
- **Niche ETFs** investing in illiquid assets can become hard to sell during market downturns.
- **Panic selling** often happens when prices drop sharply, but patience helps ride it out.
- **Swap-based ETFs** and those lending securities carry counterparty risk, though usually backed by collateral.
- **Currency risk** exists when investing in foreign currencies, but major ETF currencies are generally stable.

## Returns Through Risk

- **Return (Rendite)** is the profit you make from an investment. 
  - In the stock market, itâ€™s the **reward for taking risks**â€”the higher the risk, the higher the potential return, if things go well.
- **Volatility** measures how much a security fluctuates; higher volatility means greater risk.
- You only **lose money** when you sell at a lossâ€”before that, it's just a **paper loss**. 
- **Diversifying** your portfolio reduces the impact of individual stocks. 
- Every investment has risks, but being aware of them helps you develop strategies to **manage and minimize** them

## Different ETF Risks

### Market Risk

Exceptional situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can impact the entire market. In such cases, every company is affected to some extent. You can *not* avoid market risk when investingâ€”it exists for both individual stocks and global ETFs.

The best way to manage this risk is to **invest for the long term**. This allows you to ride out crises instead of panic-selling your shares. Unlike company-specific risks, market risk can *not* be diversified away.

### Liquidity Risks in Niche ETFs

Some ETFs track cryptocurrencies, gold mines, or real estate assets. During crises, highly specialized ETFs may face **liquidity shortages**. 

- This happens when the underlying securities are illiquid, meaning they are traded infrequently. 
- In the worst case, you might not be able to access your money immediately if you want to sell your ETF shares ðŸ˜±. However, such situations are rare in practice. This risk is not inherent to ETFs in general but arises because some ETFs are highly theme-focused. 

We recommend **investing in broadly diversified global ETFs** instead.

### Panic Selling

Triggered by a specific event, many ETF investors might decide to sell their shares simultaneously. -> When many sell, the **supply increases**, and the **price drops**. -> The lower price, in turn, may encourage even more investors to sell their shares.

Panic selling can occur with any type of investment. ETFs come with **relatively high volatility**, and prices can sometimes fall for years. Investors should avoid making **rash decisions** in response to market conditions.

#### **Panic Selling**
Stock prices can fluctuate significantly. When a stock drops abruptly, investors fear a sharp loss in value and rush to sell their shares to save as much of their capital as possible. This further drives prices down, creating a **downward spiral**. This phenomenon is called panic selling. Panic selling can significantly worsen economic crises.

### Swap Counterparty Risk

Synthetic ETFs do not directly purchase the individual assets of an index but replicate it through a financial derivative. The ETF provider enters into a **swap agreement** with a financial institution (the swap counterparty). This introduces **counterparty risk**: Theoretically, the swap partner could go bankrupt, jeopardizing the ETF's returns.

According to EU regulations, the performance difference between the collateral portfolio and the swap portfolio must not exceed 10%. If this threshold is breached, the swap must be reversed. For example, if the MSCI Emerging Markets is at â‚¬100 and the collateral portfolio is at â‚¬110, the swap must be reversed at that point. The same applies if the MSCI Emerging Markets is at â‚¬100 and the collateral portfolio is at â‚¬90. Most ETF providers reverse the swap well before reaching the 10% threshold.

### Securities Lending

-  Some ETFs lend out securities and receive a **lending fee** from the borrower. This generates additional income, which is usually passed on to you as an investor.

  -> Risk: If the borrower goes bankrupt, they may not be able to return the securities. 

- In Europe, the **maximum amount** of securities that can be lent out is **20% of the portfolio value**.

- The borrower must provide **collateral**, such as government bonds or cash, to the lender. If the value of this collateral exceeds **20% of the portfolio value**, the ETF can lend out more securities. 

- As an investor, you are protected from significant losses.

### Currency Risk

- Some of the largest funds, including certain MSCI World ETFs, are denominated in **US dollars**. 
- Like any currency, the dollar fluctuates against the euro. 
  - If the dollar is worth less at the time of your sale compared to when you bought it, your returns will suffer. 
  - This currency risk can also be an opportunity if the exchange rate moves in your favor. 
- For long-term, globally diversified investors, these fluctuations largely balance out. (Mathematically, exchange rates are a zero-sum game.)

## Conclusion

Like any investment, ETFs come with risks. However, most risks are **well-hedged** and therefore do not necessarily pose a disadvantage for you. 

As an ETF investor, you are most exposed to **market risk**. By investing in broad market segments, you bear the full impact of market fluctuations. Historically, the global economy has always shown **positive long-term growth**. Early investors who remained patient and held their shares for the long term were rewarded ðŸ’ª.
