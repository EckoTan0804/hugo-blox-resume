## ðŸ’¡Take Away
- No access to the market without a securities account: As an ETF investor, you need a brokerage account to trade ETFs or set up savings plans.

- Banks and other financial institutions offer (online) brokerage accounts. Setting one up is quick and easyâ€”you just need to verify your identity via video.

- These fees apply: account management fees (ongoing) and transaction costs (per order). Providers differ significantly in these costs.

- ETF lump-sum investment or savings plan? The product offerings vary by provider, so you should choose the one that best fits your investment strategy.

- Trading via desktop or smartphone? Some neobrokers are only accessible via smartphone. This can be convenient but may also limit your options.

## Why an ETF Investor Needs a Securities Account

A securities account, or simply a "**Depot**," is an account used to store securities. "Depot" comes from French and means storage. 

- In your securities account, you can store ETFs, index funds, stocks, bonds, or derivatives.

- Nowadays, you can open a securities account not only with traditional banks but also with online brokers or neobrokers to trade financial products.

Difference between a bank and a broker:

- **Banks** have a banking license.
- **Brokers** cannot maintain accounts themselves. Therefore, you always receive your securities account in combination with a settlement account from the partner bank of the provider.

In both cases, your money is secured, even in the event of insolvency.

Brokers issue securities accounts.

- In Germany, brokers must be approved by the financial authority.
- They are the interface between you as an investor and the financial market, enabling you to access financial products. Only with a securities account can you trade ETFs.

Nowadays, most securities accounts are online. Even though the institutions now use digital systems, your securities are secure: The provider manages your securities in a fiduciary capacity. Even if the broker goes bankrupt, you will still receive your shares.

Each securities account has a reference account, from which the amounts you want to use for securities trading are debited or deposited.

- You can transfer profits to your linked checking or settlement account.
- Earnings from ETFs, dividends, etc., will be paid out by the broker to your reference account. 
- For each of these transactions, you will find a receipt in your brokerâ€™s overview with the exact price at the time of buying or selling the security.

You can easily execute and adjust ETF savings plans or one-time investments, or sell shares via your brokerâ€™s website or app.

## Costs You Will Incur

Although the fees for trading ETFs have generally decreased, you can save a lot of money by carefully comparing brokers. There are significant differences between providers. 

Here is an overview of the cost models:

### Account Maintenance Fees

There are account maintenance fees â€“ this is either a fixed amount charged monthly or annually, or a specific percentage of the account balance, which can become expensive for large accounts.

Many accounts are even free: either for the first few months or permanently. Others have conditions that you must meet to keep them free, such as maintaining a Comdirect checking account or having an active savings plan.

### Transaction Costs: Pay Attention to Fee Models

Transaction costs are charged per order. These can vary significantly, so you should definitely compare providers to find the best solution for your investment strategy.

- Some providers charge a certain percentage per order, such as 0.2%. For one-time ETF investments with larger amounts, fees can add up quickly! ->  In this case, a provider with **flat fees per order** might be more suitable.

- Hybrid model: you pay a small amount per order plus a percentage of the fee

## How to Find the Right Securities Account (Depot)

Criteria you should specifically consider when selected a depot:

{{< spoiler text="What type of securities are you trading?" >}}

Some accounts are better suited for ETF investors than others because they offer a broader selection of ETFs. Many brokers focused on individual stocks only offer ETFs from specific providers, which limits your choices.


{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="How will you invest in ETFs: as a lump sum or via a savings plan?" >}}

How high is your savings rate in the latter case? Depending on this, different providers might be more suitable for you.
- Because their fees vary and
-  Because some providers offer free savings plans or allow you to start with small savings rates from around â‚¬25.

{{< spoiler text="Which ETFs do you want to invest in?" >}}

ESG, niche ETFs, and even different replication methods may not be available with all providers. Therefore, itâ€™s worth establishing a clear strategy beforehand to ensure that your broker offers the ETFs you want.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Do you prefer trading on your smartphone or desktop?" >}}

New neo-brokers sometimes only offer apps. Some people find this very practical, while others prefer having an overview on their desktop. Itâ€™s a matter of personal preference. For those who find both too modern, itâ€™s still possible to go to a bank branch.

{{< spoiler text="Joint or individual account?" >}}

We recommend using separate accounts for couples, as this could have tax advantages. Learn more in our guide on taxes and ETFs.

If your priorities change or you want to switch to a new strategy, you can always switch your broker. Most providers will transfer your ETFs for free and easily.

## How to Get Your Securities Account

### Open a securities account

**Opening a securities account** is easy and takes only 10-15 minutes: Choose the offer that best suits your needs  and follow the instructions on the provider's website. 

- The account opening is usually free; some providers offer bonus programs or other benefits. 
- Brokers are legally required to verify your identity. Most providers use video identification via webcam or smartphone for this.

### Deposit money

Before you can buy ETFs, you need to **deposit money** into your reference account. Depending on the provider, you will receive the account details by mail and may have to wait a few days. Transfers can also take up to two days, depending on the financial institution. After that, you can use the money in your settlement account to purchase securities.

### Answer securities trading questionnaire

Before placing your first orders, your broker will ask you if you have experience in trading securities. This is the so-called **securities trading questionnaire**, which providers in Germany are legally required to complete. You can select different asset classes. If you have no prior experience with ETFs, you will be asked for confirmation when executing your savings plan or lump sum investment.
