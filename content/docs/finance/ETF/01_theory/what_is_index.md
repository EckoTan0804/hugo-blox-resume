## ðŸ’¡Take Away

- An index is a numerical indicator that tracks the price performance of a specific group of stocks. 
- Indices can represent industries, sectors, or regions. Some indices include only a handful of securities, while others cover over 1,000.

- ETFs and index funds replicate these indices, allowing you to benefit from their performance at a low cost. 
- The most well-known German index is the **DAX (Deutscher Aktienindex)**, which tracks the top 40 German companies.

## What is an Index?

An index is calculated to illustrate price developments. 

{{< spoiler text="Example" >}}

The ***\*Consumer Price Index (CPI)\**** is determined by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, which examines the prices of ***\*650 goods\**** each month. These goods represent what German households typically consume, including categories like food, housing, and transportation. Every month, the prices of the same basket of goods are checked. By analyzing the price changes of this basket, inflation can be measured.


{{< /spoiler >}}

Similarly, a **stock index** tracks the price movements of numerous stocks. It provides a snapshot of how a specific group of stocks is performing, making it easier to understand market trends.

### The German Stock Index (DAX)

The <mark>**DAX (Deutscher Aktienindex)**</mark>, the German stock index, tracks the performance of the **40 largest German companies**. It serves as a barometer for the stock market.

To be included in the DAX, a company must meet specific criteria. For example, DAX companies must:

- Be headquartered in Germany,
- Be listed on the stock exchange,
- Be among the **40 largest German companies** by **free-float market capitalization**.

During trading hours, **Xetra** calculates the DAX every second, providing real-time updates on its performance.

**Xetra**

The **Deutsche BÃ¶rse AG** is a company that provides stock exchange infrastructure, ensuring that trading functions smoothly. One of its most significant trading platforms is **Xetra**, which stands for **"Exchange Electronic Trading"**. Xetra enables electronic stock exchange trading, allowing you to buy and sell **stocks** and **ETFs**.

Similar to a stock price, you can also track an index using a chart. However, the value of an index does not represent a single company but summarizes the performance of an entire market. For example, the **DAX** shows how the **top 40 German companies** have performed over the past minutes, weeks, or years.

## Fluctuations in Stock Indices

Indices generally fluctuate less than individual stocks because they represent multiple companies, resulting in **lower volatility**. However, indices can still experience significant fluctuations, especially during political or economic crises. For example, at the onset of the **COVID-19 pandemic**, the DAX dropped below **9,000 points** in a short period, reaching its lowest level since **February 2016**.

**Volatility**
The term volatility generally refers to fluctuations. High volatility means that a stock price or market value experiences significant swings.

## Index Types

There are various indices that reflect different developments. Depending on the information you need, you may refer to different indices. In the investment sector, the most important indices are those that track **price** or **performance**. Every country has a **benchmark index** that represents its top companies.

### Price Index

- A **price index** reflects the pure price development of stocks. 
  - In the case of a **dividend payout**, the dividend amount is subtracted from the stock's value, causing the index to drop at the time of the payout. 
- The most well-known example of a price index is the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**, which tracks the **30 largest publicly traded companies** in the United States.

{{% callout  note %}}
**Dividend**
A company can share its profits with shareholders by distributing dividends. Shareholders benefit from this cash flow, which is freely available money. To pay dividends, a company does not necessarily need to make a profit; it can also draw this amount from other sources. Dividend payments are entirely voluntary, and a company may choose to reinvest its profits instead.

### Performance Index

- A **performance index**, also known as a **total return index**, measures the growth in value of capital investments. 
- Unlike a price index, the index publisher includes **capital changes** and **dividend payouts** in the calculation. Dividends are **reinvested**, meaning they are added back into the index. As a result, the performance index does not lose value after a dividend payout.
- One of the most well-known performance indices is the **DAX-40**. The **DAX Performance Index** receives significantly more international attention than the DAX Price Index because it provides a comprehensive overview of the index's total value development by including dividends.

### Benchmark Index

- A **benchmark index** lists the most important companies of a nation. 

- For example, the **DAX** is the German benchmark index, and the **Nikkei 225** is the Japanese benchmark index. 

  ![Was ist ein Leitindex?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Leitindex_-1024x575.jpg)

- Using a benchmark index, you can gain a good overview of a country's stock market. Geopolitical decisions often have significant impacts on companies, and these effects can frequently be observed in the index.

## How are Indices Weighted?

The criteria for inclusion in an index depend on the organization that publishes it. 

- The **DAX** is calculated by **Deutsche BÃ¶rse AG**, which uses **free float** and **market capitalization** to determine which **40 companies** are included. 
  - **Free float** refers to the number of shares available for trading by investors, while **market capitalization** indicates the total value of a company's outstanding shares.
  - Once a yearâ€”in **September**â€”Deutsche BÃ¶rse AG reviews and decides on changes to the DAX. Companies may be removed from the **DAX 40**, or new companies may be added. 
- The **Dow Jones**, the most important U.S. index, uses a different weighting method: it is **price-weighted**. The higher a stock's price, the greater its weight in the index.

**Stock Exchange**
A stock exchange is a marketplace where stocks and other securities are traded, bringing buyers and sellers together. Stock exchanges have fixed trading hours and rules. In Germany, there are eight securities exchanges, with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange being the most important.

## From Index to ETF

You can *not* invest directly in a stock index. However, some fund providers replicate indices exactly, allowing you to benefit from the performance of a stock index. **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** automatically track the performance of indices. There are ETFs for almost all stock indices, including the **DAX**, **MSCI World**, and **S&P 500**. You can easily buy shares of ETFs through an online broker.

ETFs are significantly cheaper compared to actively managed funds. Actively managed funds require entire teams of analysts and fund managers, whose salaries drive up costs. ETFs, on the other hand, operate fully automatically, following the index. As an investment model, ETFs are becoming increasingly popular among private investors because they offer **lower risk and costs** compared to investing in individual stocks.
