## **Get Honest About Why You Want More**

- Many people are raised to always be ‚Äúthe best,‚Äù but this can lead to blindly chasing more without asking *why*.

- Financial advice often focuses on ‚Äúmore, more, more‚Äù instead of defining what‚Äôs *enough*.

- Many people decide to take control of their finances (good), then change their lives to save money (good), then continue saving and become increasingly aggressive (not so good), and finally end up ‚Äúliving in the spreadsheet,‚Äù where they spend each day counting how much their money has grown (very bad).
- The key question is: ***Why do you want more?***
  - **High-level** answers like ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù or ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù are too vague; they don‚Äôt motivate strongly.
  - True motivation comes from **street-level** reasons‚Äîconcrete, daily-life benefits.
    - Examples: Taking a taxi instead of sweating on the train, Paying for a friend to join a glamping trip, etc.
  - Exercise: Bring your motivation ‚Äúfrom the clouds to the street.‚Äù Define your specific reason

## **How to Accumulate More and Grow Faster: Feed Your System**

- Automated investing system is fueled by only one thing: the money you feed it.
- After building the system, now the focus is: **volume of contributions** ‚Üí more in, more out. üí™
- Key driver: **invest as much as possible, as early as possible**, to maximize compounding.

## **How Rich Will I Be In ? Years**

Verify the compounding effect yourself: Go to [bankrate.com](bankrate.com) and open up one of their investment calculators. Enter in your monthly investment contribution, assuming an 8 percent return. 

- You‚Äôll likely see that your current contributions will grow more slowly than you thought. 
- But by adding a small amount per month‚Äîeven `$100` or `$200` more‚Äîthe numbers will change dramatically!

Next step: go **beyond the savings/investing percentages** in your Conscious Spending Plan and invest as much as possible. üí™

- Optimize spending plan to free more money for investments.
- Negotiate major purchases (car, house) for better deals.
- Cut expenses ruthlessly where possible.
- Negotiate higher salary or find a higher-paying job.

**Shovel as much as possible into your investment system each month**.(The earlier and more you invest, the sooner you‚Äôll reach your financial goals.)

## **Rebalancing Your Investments**

While target date funds handle this automatically, self-managed portfolios require periodic **rebalancing** - Diversified portfolios have uneven growth and some assets outperform others (e.g., international stocks).

**Goal: Maintain original asset allocation and avoid any sector dominating the portfolio.**

**Rebalancing steps:**

- If some assets outperform the others

  - Stop contributing to the outperforming asset temporarily.

  - Redirect contributions to underrepresented assets until allocation is back on target.

  - Resume automatic contributions once balance is restored.

- If a fund loses value -> pause other contributions and add money to the underperforming fund until its allocation returns to target.

Tools: **personalcapital.com** can help calculate and guide rebalancing.

## **Stop Worrying About Taxes**

{{< spoiler text="Tax Truth #1: People think getting a tax refund is bad. In reality, it‚Äôs great." >}}

- **The Myth**: Getting a tax refund is bad because you‚Äôve given Uncle Sam an interest-free loan. 
- **Reality**: You would have spent that money. We know this because data shows that small tax refunds that are gradually added to your paycheck get spent. Big tax refunds get saved or used to pay off debt.
- **Surprising Fact**: This is why politicians have a hard choice to make when it comes to tax cuts. Give people small tax refunds over the year and they‚Äôll spend it, stimulating the economy . . . but they won‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre getting more money and give the politicians credit. Or, give them a big tax refund and your administration will get credit‚Äîbut people will save it or pay off debt, not stimulate the economy.

{{< spoiler text="Tax Truth #2: The US is not the highest-taxed nation in the world." >}}

- **The Myth:** America is the highest-taxed nation in the world.
- **Reality:** Not even close.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Tax Truth #3: People actually think that it‚Äôs better to NOT make more money for tax reasons. They are wrong." >}}

- **The Myth:** Making more money will move you up in tax brackets, causing you to get taxed more and actually earn less.
- **Reality:** ‚ÄúMarginal tax brackets.‚Äù: the ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù amount‚Äîor the money in the higher tax bracket‚Äîis taxed at a higher rate, *not the entire amount you earn*.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Tax Truth #4: People get really angry about how their taxes are spent but actually have no goddamn idea where the money goes." >}}

- **The Myth:** We spend a ton of money on foreign aid.
- **Reality:** Out of every $100 in federal taxes you pay, around 1 percent goes toward foreign aid, which is dramatically lower than most people think.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Tax Truth #5: People think rich people just use loopholes to never pay taxes." >}}

- **The Myth:** There are a lot of loopholes for the rich.
- **Reality:** There are a few legit ones‚Äîlike tax efficiency in your investment accounts, maxing out your tax-advantaged accounts, and a few more‚Äîbut not nearly as many as you think. In general, those loopholes are few and far between and largely available to the super-rich who earn millions via capital gains (not ordinary salaries or even the high salaries of lawyers and bankers).
- **Surprise:** There are certain loopholes for the super-rich that you probably haven‚Äôt heard about. If you earn multiple six figures, go to my website for my course on advanced personal finance.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Tax Truth #6: Your politics cloud your rational judgment on taxes." >}}

- **The Myth:** There are a lot of loopholes for the rich.
- **Reality:** Your personal psychology, along with your sources of information, play a huge role in your beliefs about taxes. As *Psychology Today* noted, ‚ÄúPeople have a number of general beliefs about what kinds of exchanges should be taxable, and they want tax law to fit with those beliefs. When tax law conflicts with those beliefs, then people think the tax is unfair.‚Äù

{{< /spoiler >}}

Don‚Äôt be distracted by nonsense about taxes; analyze critically and make your own decisions.

- Use every **legal** tax advantage available (e.g., tax-advantaged accounts); this is practical and saves thousands.
- Apply the **85 Percent Solution**: do a few key things well (good enough), then move on‚Äîdon‚Äôt chase perfection.
- Most exotic-sounding tax schemes are BS; they rarely help ordinary people. Only ultra-high-net-worth individuals (earning millions, especially from capital gains) have access to meaningful advanced loopholes.
- Focus first on growing your money and implementing basic, effective tax strategies rather than hunting obscure tricks.

### **The One Thing You Need to Know About Taxes and Investments**

Invest as much as possible into tax-deferred accounts like your 401(k) and IRA.

- Major benefits:
  - Significant tax savings.
  - No need to stress over tax-efficient funds.
  - Avoid timing sales to dodge end-of-year tax distributions.

- Investing through retirement accounts eliminates most tax worries.

This is the **85 Percent Solution** for taxes: do this one big thing, then move on.

## The Annual Financial Checklist

It‚Äôs important to maintain your automated financial system. Spend a few hours re- reviewing my system and making any changes necessary every year.

{{< spoiler text="Evaluate your Conscious Spending Plan " >}}
Use these as general guidelines, but take them seriously: If your money is following these suggested percentages, that‚Äôs a Big Win toward a Rich Life.
- [ ] Fixed costs (50‚Äì60%)
- [ ] Investments (10%)
- [ ] Savings (5‚Äì10%)
- [ ] Guilt-Free Spending (20‚Äì35%)
- [ ] Reassess current subscriptions (cut if necessary).
- [ ] Renegotiate cable and internet bills.
- [ ] Revisit spending goals: Are they accurate? Are you actively saving for them?
- [ ] If your fixed costs are too high, it may be time to look at a cheaper rent (or AirBnB‚Äôing a room
out, or earning more).
- [ ] If you aren‚Äôt investing at least 10 percent, it‚Äôs worth finding the money from somewhere else‚Äî usually guilt-free spending‚Äîand reallocating it to investments.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Negotiate any fees" >}}
Many companies will offer you introductory rates or lower your monthly fees if you ask. Use my word-for-word scripts at iwillteachyoutoberich.com/negotiate.
- [ ] Cell phone bill
- [ ] Car insurance
- [ ] Cable and internet
- [ ] Bank fees
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Investments" >}}
- [ ] Confirm you‚Äôre contributing the max to your 401(k), that your money is being invested (not just sent over and sitting there‚Äîfor a cautionary tale), and that it‚Äôs being invested in the right fund(s).

- [ ] Confirm you‚Äôre contributing the max to your Roth IRA, that your money is being invested (not just sent over and sitting there), and that it‚Äôs being invested in the right fund(s).

- [ ] Be sure you‚Äôre taking advantage of all the tax-advantaged accounts you can

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Debt" >}}
- [ ] Revisit your debt payoff plan: Are you on track? Can you pay any of your debt off sooner?

- [ ] Check your credit report and credit score.

- [ ] Renegotiate your credit cards‚Äô APRs.


{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Credit cards" >}}

- [ ] Make a plan to use your credit card points! (Some might expire, some might not‚Äîbut you earned them. Now have fun with them!)

- [ ] Call to ask what other perks your credit card offers that you haven‚Äôt taken advantage of.

- [ ] Confirm you‚Äôre not paying any unnecessary fees. If you are, try to negotiate them down.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Earn more" >}}

## **Knowing When to Sell Your Investments**

### **Why you should think twice about selling**

- **Short-term vs long-term taxes**: Short-term tax (<1 year) could be much higher than long-term.

- **Why hold long term**:

  - Normal people can‚Äôt time the market.

  - Buy-and-hold investing produces dramatically higher returns than frequent trading. 

- **Best strategy**:

  - Use target date funds or index funds for a simple, tax-efficient portfolio.

  - Invest via retirement accounts 
  - Hold your investments for the long term.

### When should sell an investment

When you‚Äôre young, there are only three reasons to sell an investment:

{{< spoiler text="You need the money for an emergency." >}}

If you suddenly need money for an emergency, here‚Äôs your hierarchy of where to get it. 

1. Use your savings account.

2. Earn additional money. 
   - Drive for Uber, sell old clothes, pick up tutoring. 
   - You might not be able to earn a huge amount in a short time, but selling some of your own goods is an important psychological step‚Äîit will let you prove how serious you are both to yourself and to your family (which will be useful if you‚Äôre asking them for help).
3. Ask your family if you can borrow the money from them. Note: This doesn‚Äôt work if your family is crazy.
4. Use the money in your retirement accounts. 
   - You can always withdraw the principal you contributed to your Roth IRA penalty-free, although you‚Äôll be severely retarding your money‚Äôs ability to compound over time. With a 401(k), you can take money out for ‚Äúhardship withdrawals,‚Äù which typically include medical expenses, buying a home, tuition, preventing foreclosure, and funeral expenses, but you‚Äôll probably still pay early withdrawal fees. 
   - If it comes to this, consult your HR representative. But I urge you to avoid cashing out your retirement accounts because of the penalties and taxes involved.
5. Use your credit card only as a last resort. I can‚Äôt emphasize this enough: The chances are very good that your credit card will gouge you as you‚Äôre repaying it, so don‚Äôt do this unless you‚Äôre truly desperate!

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="You made a terrible investment that's consistently underperforming." >}}

- This point is largely moot if you invested in an index fund or series of index funds, because they reflect the entire index‚Äôs performance.
  - If your ‚Äútotal market index fund‚Äù is going down, that means the entire market is down. 
  - If you believe the market will recover, that means investments are on sale for cheaper prices than before, meaning not only should you *not* sell, but you should keep investing and pick up shares at a cheaper price.
- If you invest in individual stock, and it is currently having a poor performance (e.g., down by 35%)
  - Just because they‚Äôre plunging doesn‚Äôt mean that you should sell immediately! Check the **industry context** before selling:  Is it still viable? Are there competitors replacing it? etc.
    - If the entire industry is down ‚Üí likely a cyclical downturn ‚Üí hold and continue buying.
    - If the industry is obsolete ‚Üí sell. (For example, if you own shares in a company that‚Äôs producing CD players, chances are that business is not coming back.)
    - If your stock is down but peers are performing well ‚Üí problem is company-specific ‚Üí consider selling.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="You achieved your specific goal." >}}

- if your goal is *less than* five years away, you should set up a savings goal in your savings account. 
- But if you‚Äôve invested money for a longer-term goal that you‚Äôve achieved, sell and don‚Äôt think twice. That‚Äôs a great investing success, and you should use the money for whatever your original goal was.

{{< /spoiler >}}

## Financial Options for Super Achievers: Make the Ten Year Plan That Few Others Do

Just ask people five to ten years older than you what they wish they had started earlier, then do that.

{{< spoiler text="Create an emergency fund." >}}

- Set up an extra savings goal and then funnel money to it in the same way you would your other goals.
- your emergency fund should contain **6 - 12 months** of spending money (which includes everything: your mortgage, payments on other loans, food, transportation, taxes, gifts, and anything else you would conceivably spend on).

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Insurance" >}}

- Focus on necessary coverage.

- As a young person, you likely don‚Äôt need to buy a bunch of insurance options right now, but you can certainly set up a savings goal so that when you do need them, you‚Äôll have money to use.
- Insurance is almost never a good investment. Use it as protection from downside risk‚Äîlike for fires or accidental death when you have a family‚Äîbut don‚Äôt think of it as a growth investment.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="Children's education" >}}

- Whether or not you have children yet, your first goal should be to excel financially for yourself.
- First, get out of debt and save for your own retirement. Then you can worry about your kids.

{{< /spoiler >}}

The best way to prepare yourself is to talk to successful people who are somewhat older than you and have their act together. Their advice can be invaluable‚Äîand can give you an edge on planning for the next decade.
