You need a way to put that money to work for you so it earns more than even the highest-yielding savings account, and la is the first and best way to do it.

## Investing is the Single Most Effective Way to Get Rich

By opening an investment account, you give yourself access to the biggest moneymaking vehicle in the history of the world: the stock market.

Setting up an account is an excellent first step toward actually investing.

## **The Ladder of Personal Finance**

These are the five systematic steps you should take to invest. Each step builds on the previous one.

1. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, invest to take full advantage of it and contribute just enough to get 100 percent of the match.
2. Pay off your credit card and any other debt.
3. Open up a Roth IRA
4. If you have money left over, go back to your 401(k) and contribute as much as possible to it (this time above and beyond your employer match).
5. If you still have money left to invest, open a regular nonretirement account and put as much as possible there.
