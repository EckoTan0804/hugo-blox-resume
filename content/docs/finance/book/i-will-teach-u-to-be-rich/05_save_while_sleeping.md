## **Do More Before Doing Less**

The Curve of Doing More Before Doing Less:

![Êà™Â±è2025-08-11_22.24.06](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2025-08-11_22.24.06.png)

- It would be easier to do nothing‚Äîbut that would mean you‚Äôd have to manage your money constantly for the rest of your life.

- Setting up an Automatic Money Flow will take you a few hours up front, but you‚Äôll end up saving huge amounts of time over the long term.

  ‚Üí Your money flow will be **automatic**, and each dollar that comes in will be routed to the right account in your Conscious Spending Plan

## **The Power of Defaults**

The key to taking action is simply **making your decisions automatic**.

## **How to Spend Only 90 Minutes a Month Managing Your Money**

Let‚Äôs take your Conscious Spending Plan and make it automatic. üí™

Use a concept called the **Next \$100**

- Allocate the next `$100` **according to your Conscious Spending Plan** (e.g.,`$50` to fixed costs, `$10` to investment, `$10` to savings, `$20` to guilt-free spending)

## **Create Your Automatic Money Flow**

1. Start by linking all your accounts together
2. Set up automatic transfers to happen on various days

Example:

### **Tweaking the System for You**

- ***If you‚Äôre paid twice a month***

  - Replicate the above system on the first and the fifteenth‚Äîwith half the money each time
  - Save a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù of money, which you can use to simulate getting paid once a month.

- ***If you have irregular income***

  In months where you make a lot, you‚Äôre going to save and build a buffer for the slow months. Over time, you‚Äôll build enough of a buffer that you can simulate a stable income, letting you use this system as designed.

## Review Your Credit Card Bill

## When Do I Get to Spend My Money?

Once you‚Äôve gotten your money under control and you‚Äôre hitting your targets, you absolutely should spend your leftover money.

Living only for tomorrow is no way to live. Consider one investment that most people overlook: yourself. If you invest in yourself, the potential return is limitless.

If you‚Äôre meeting your goals, another route you could take is to start saving less and increase the amount you allocate to your guilt- free spending money.

## Advantage of Automatic Money Flow/System

The beauty of this system is that it works without your involvement and it‚Äôs flexible enough to add or remove accounts anytime. You‚Äôre accumulating money by default.

- ***Your automated money flow takes advantage of human psychology.***
- ***Your system will grow with you.***
- ***Your system lets you go from ‚Äúhot‚Äù to ‚Äúcool.***‚Äù
