## The Benefits of Financial Planning

### The basiss of financial planning

At a high level financial planning is **the process of assessing where you stand, where you want to go, and then plotting the course to get there one step at a time.**

- It's about bringing all the pieces of your financial life together into one cohesive picture.
  - Investing
  - Paying down debt
  - Saving for emergency
  - etc.

- Only then can you truly understand where you stand, how you compare, and what you should do next to progress towards your financial goals.

With personal finances, time can either be your best friend or your worst enemy. Just like with health or most other things in life, small healthy habits started earlier have a larger impact than more drastic actions taken later.

### Tips for creating a financial plan

A financial plan is not just another word for budget or debt-reduction plan. It’s the **long-term roadmap** that could help make your vision for the future a reality. 

Keypoints

- Establishing a financial plan involves setting specific goals (such as building an emergency fund, growing retirement accounts, and eliminating high-interest debt).
- Analyzing resources requires gathering financial documents to assess income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, ultimately calculating net worth to measure progress. ($\text{net worth} = \text{assets} - \text{liabilities}$)
- Understanding monthly cash flow helps identify spending habits by categorizing expenditures into essential and non-essential items, revealing opportunities to cut costs.
- Creating a budget aligns spending with priorities, with methods like the 50/30/20 rule helping to allocate income effectively towards needs, wants, and savings.
- Investing in long-term financial growth becomes possible once debts are managed and an emergency fund is established, allowing for contributions to retirement and taxable investment accounts.

{{< spoiler text="1. Setting Your Goals" >}}

Common top goals

- **Having an emergency fund.**

  - Generally, you’ll want to have to have at least three to six months worth of living expenses set aside in an emergency savings account. (If you’re self-employed or your income fluctuates, you might aim for six to 12 month’s worth of expenses.) 
  - This can be used to cover those unexpected expenses that invariably pop up, or float you through a loss of income, without wrecking your plan.

- **Growing your retirement accounts.**

  If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing at least 100% of what they’ll match. Combine that with the magic of [compound interest](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/how-compound-interest-grows-investments/), and you could see your balance grow at a nice pace.

- **Eliminating high-interest debt.**

Other goals

- **Establishing (and maintaining) good credit.**

- **Paying off your student loans.**

- **Living within your means.** 

  Ideally, you don’t want to put anything on your credit card that you can’t pay off in full at the end of the month (or relatively soon thereafter), since this is an expensive form of debt.

- **Saving for your kids’ education.**

- **Growing your investment portfolio.**

{{< spoiler text="2. Understanding Your Resources" >}}

- Gather up all your paper and electronic bank statements, billing accounts, and portfolio documents. This might include:

  - **Income:** Salary, investment income, alimony

  - **Expenses:** Bank statements reflecting withdrawals or other debits, monthly billing statements, and other sources of everyday spending

  - **Assets:** Savings accounts, home equity, or physical items you own (car, collectibles, etc.)

  - **Liabilities:** Credit card debt, student loans, mortgage(s), and any other sources of debt

- Next, you can use these documents to calculate your [net worth](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/how-to-calculate-your-net-worth/). 

  - Simply list all of your assets (such as bank and investment accounts, real estate, valuable personal property) and then all your debts (like credit cards, mortgages, student loans). Your assets minus your liabilities equals your net worth.
  - If you find that your liabilities exceed your assets, don’t panic. This is a common scenario when you're just starting out. With a financial plan in place, your net worth should grow over time.

{{< spoiler text="3. Analyzing Monthly Cash Flow" >}}

It’s a good idea to get a sense of your **monthly cash flow — what’s coming in and what’s going out**. 

- You can use your bank statements from the last three or so months to come up with an average cash inflow and outflow.
  - If you find that your monthly outflow equals your monthly inflow (i.e., you’re not saving anything) or your outflow actually exceeds your inflow (meaning you’re living beyond your means), you’ll want to drill further down into the outflow column.
- Start by making a list of all your spending categories and the average you spend on each per month. Then divide the list into two main categories
  - essential spending (e.g., rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance, debt payments) and 
  - non-essential spending (such as entertainment, shopping, travel, clothing).

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="4. Updating Your Budget" >}}

One simple approach is the **50/30/20 rule**. To use this rule, you divide your after-tax income into three categories:

- **Needs (50%)**
  - Rent or mortgage payments
  - Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet)
  - Groceries
  - Transportation (gas, public transit, car payments)
  - Insurance (health, auto, home)
  - Minimum debt payments

- **Wants (30%)**
  - Dining out and entertainment
  - Shopping (clothes, gadgets, hobbies)
  - Travel and vacations
  - Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, gym memberships)

- **Savings and debt repayment beyond the minimum (20%)**
  - Savings (emergency fund, retirement accounts)
  - Investments (stocks, real estate, mutual funds)
  - Extra debt payments (beyond the minimum)

{{< spoiler text="5. Tackling High-Interest Debt" >}}

Getting out from under high-interest debt (such as credit card balances, payday loans, or rent-to-own payments) is an important part of any financial plan.

- [Avalanche method](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/debt-avalanche-method-of-paying-off-debt/)
  - List your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest. 
  - Throw all of your extra cash to the highest interest debt while continuing to make the minimum monthly payment on the others. 
  - Once you’ve paid off the highest interest debt, you move on to the next-highest interest debt, and so on.
- [Snowball method](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/pros-of-debt-snowball-method/)
  - List your debts from smallest to largest based on balance size.
  - put all your extra cash toward the debt with the smallest balance, while making the minimum monthly payment on the others. 
  - When that is paid off, you move on the next-smallest debt, and so on. This approach can help you stay motivated by achieving early wins.
- [Debt consolidation](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/how-debt-consolidation-works/): transferring your credit card debt to a balance transfer card or personal loan with a lower interest rate — allowing you to focus on just one monthly payment.
