## The Benefits of Financial Planning

### The Basiss of Financial Planning

At a high level financial planning is **the process of assessing where you stand, where you want to go, and then plotting the course to get there one step at a time.**

- It's about bringing all the pieces of your financial life together into one cohesive picture.
  - Investing
  - Paying down debt
  - Saving for emergency
  - etc.

- Only then can you truly understand where you stand, how you compare, and what you should do next to progress towards your financial goals.

With personal finances, time can either be your best friend or your worst enemy. Just like with health or most other things in life, small healthy habits started earlier have a larger impact than more drastic actions taken later.

### Tips for Creating a Financial Plan

A financial plan is not just another word for budget or debt-reduction plan. It’s the **long-term roadmap** that could help make your vision for the future a reality. 

Keypoints

- Establishing a financial plan involves setting specific goals (such as building an emergency fund, growing retirement accounts, and eliminating high-interest debt).
- Analyzing resources requires gathering financial documents to assess income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, ultimately calculating net worth to measure progress. ($\text{net worth} = \text{assets} - \text{liabilities}$)
- Understanding monthly cash flow helps identify spending habits by categorizing expenditures into essential and non-essential items, revealing opportunities to cut costs.
- Creating a budget aligns spending with priorities, with methods like the 50/30/20 rule helping to allocate income effectively towards needs, wants, and savings.
- Investing in long-term financial growth becomes possible once debts are managed and an emergency fund is established, allowing for contributions to retirement and taxable investment accounts.

{{< spoiler text="1. Setting Your Goals" >}}

Common top goals

- **Having an emergency fund.**

  - Generally, you’ll want to have to have at least three to six months worth of living expenses set aside in an emergency savings account. (If you’re self-employed or your income fluctuates, you might aim for six to 12 month’s worth of expenses.) 
  - This can be used to cover those unexpected expenses that invariably pop up, or float you through a loss of income, without wrecking your plan.

- **Growing your retirement accounts.**

  If your employer offers a matching contribution, consider contributing at least 100% of what they’ll match. Combine that with the magic of [compound interest](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/how-compound-interest-grows-investments/), and you could see your balance grow at a nice pace.

- **Eliminating high-interest debt.**

Other goals

- **Establishing (and maintaining) good credit.**

- **Paying off your student loans.**

- **Living within your means.** 

  Ideally, you don’t want to put anything on your credit card that you can’t pay off in full at the end of the month (or relatively soon thereafter), since this is an expensive form of debt.

- **Saving for your kids’ education.**

- **Growing your investment portfolio.** 

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="2. Understanding Your Resources" >}}

- Gather up all your paper and electronic bank statements, billing accounts, and portfolio documents. This might include:

  - **Income:** Salary, investment income, alimony

  - **Expenses:** Bank statements reflecting withdrawals or other debits, monthly billing statements, and other sources of everyday spending

  - **Assets:** Savings accounts, home equity, or physical items you own (car, collectibles, etc.)

  - **Liabilities:** Credit card debt, student loans, mortgage(s), and any other sources of debt

- Next, you can use these documents to calculate your [net worth](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/how-to-calculate-your-net-worth/). 

  - Simply list all of your assets (such as bank and investment accounts, real estate, valuable personal property) and then all your debts (like credit cards, mortgages, student loans). Your assets minus your liabilities equals your net worth.
  - If you find that your liabilities exceed your assets, don’t panic. This is a common scenario when you're just starting out. With a financial plan in place, your net worth should grow over time.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="3. Analyzing Monthly Cash Flow" >}}

It’s a good idea to get a sense of your **monthly cash flow — what’s coming in and what’s going out**. 

- You can use your bank statements from the last three or so months to come up with an average cash inflow and outflow.
  - If you find that your monthly outflow equals your monthly inflow (i.e., you’re not saving anything) or your outflow actually exceeds your inflow (meaning you’re living beyond your means), you’ll want to drill further down into the outflow column.
- Start by making a list of all your spending categories and the average you spend on each per month. Then divide the list into two main categories
  - essential spending (e.g., rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, insurance, debt payments) and 
  - non-essential spending (such as entertainment, shopping, travel, clothing).

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="4. Updating Your Budget" >}}

One simple approach is the **50/30/20 rule**. To use this rule, you divide your after-tax income into three categories:

- **Needs (50%)**
  - Rent or mortgage payments
  - Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet)
  - Groceries
  - Transportation (gas, public transit, car payments)
  - Insurance (health, auto, home)
  - Minimum debt payments

- **Wants (30%)**
  - Dining out and entertainment
  - Shopping (clothes, gadgets, hobbies)
  - Travel and vacations
  - Subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, gym memberships)

- **Savings and debt repayment beyond the minimum (20%)**
  - Savings (emergency fund, retirement accounts)
  - Investments (stocks, real estate, mutual funds)
  - Extra debt payments (beyond the minimum)

{{< spoiler text="5. Tackling High-Interest Debt" >}}

Getting out from under high-interest debt (such as credit card balances, payday loans, or rent-to-own payments) is an important part of any financial plan.

- [Avalanche method](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/debt-avalanche-method-of-paying-off-debt/)
  - List your debts from the highest interest rate to the lowest. 
  - Throw all of your extra cash to the highest interest debt while continuing to make the minimum monthly payment on the others. 
  - Once you’ve paid off the highest interest debt, you move on to the next-highest interest debt, and so on.
- [Snowball method](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/pros-of-debt-snowball-method/)
  - List your debts from smallest to largest based on balance size.
  - put all your extra cash toward the debt with the smallest balance, while making the minimum monthly payment on the others. 
  - When that is paid off, you move on the next-smallest debt, and so on. This approach can help you stay motivated by achieving early wins.
- [Debt consolidation](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/how-debt-consolidation-works/): transferring your credit card debt to a balance transfer card or personal loan with a lower interest rate — allowing you to focus on just one monthly payment.

### How to plan for your future

#### Setting Goals: What and Why

How you plan for your future depends, in large part, on what your goals are. When you know why you’re moving towards a certain goal, it can provide powerful motivation for you to stay the course, even if something unexpected happens.

{{% callout  warning %}}
💡 Quick Tip: If you’re opening a brokerage account for the first time, consider starting with an amount of money you’re prepared to lose. Investing always includes the risk of loss, and until you’ve gained some experience, it’s probably wise to start small.
{{% /callout %}}

#### Understanding the Now

Another critical step for planning for the future includes calculating where you are right now, including

- your assets (what you own)
- your debts (what you owe)
- your income (what you bring in)
- your expenses (what you pay out)

As far as income goes, tally up how much you make monthly from wages/salaries, bonuses, and so on.

Then, list your fixed expenses, which could include your rent or mortgage payment, monthly utilities, property taxes (if applicable), insurance premiums, prescription costs, groceries, gas, and so forth. Also look at what you spend on clothing, hobbies, entertainment, and dining out.

#### Creating a Financial Plan

When thinking about how to plan for the future, it might be helpful to connect the dots between where you are today and where you want to be to achieve the goals you’ve set.

If you have multiple goals to accomplish, prioritizing them. It is very helpful to cultivate a **pay-yourself-first** attitude: the top priority is to put a predetermined amount of money into personal savings and investment accounts.

{{% callout  note %}}
💡 Quick Tip: When you’re actively investing in stocks, it’s important to ask what types of fees you might have to pay. For example, brokers may charge a flat fee for trading stocks, or require some commission for every trade. Taking the time to manage investment costs can be beneficial over the long term.

#### Implementing Your Plan

Once you’ve formulated a plan, it’s time to put it into action. Automate steps/payments to reduce the amount of time spent on managing this part of the plan.

#### Monitoring Your Progress

Include at least an annual review — or perhaps you prefer to do it biannually or quarterly — to see how your plan is progressing.

#### Investments: Planning for the Future

In general, there are three investor types:

{{< spoiler text="active investor" >}}

- Involved in each aspect of investing, embracing a hands-on approach
- Buys stocks or other investments, and likely does research to decide which types of investments to make.

An active investor can have a professionally managed portfolio or they could choose to manage their own portfolio, if they believe they have the skills and expertise to do so. But there are <u>risks</u> involved, which include potentially losing money, so you’ll need to figure out [how much risk you are comfortable with](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-your-risk-tolerance/).

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="passive investor/low-maintenance investor" >}}

- Passive investor: Investing but don’t want to be significantly involved in making investment decisions
  - “Buy-and-hold” philosophy where you buy securities and plan to hold on to them for a longer period of time, throughout fluctuations of the market.

{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler text="hands-off investor/automatic investor" >}}

If you’re open to more activity on your investment account, but you don’t want to spend much personal time studying the market, [rebalancing your portfolio](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/when-to-rebalance-portfolio/), and otherwise handling all the details, then you may want to consider **automated investing**.

- Use computer algorithms to generate tailored investment advice and financial planning. It may reduce the learning curve for some beginner investors, helping them start building and managing a portfolio to achieve their financial goals.
- Use computer algorithms to select and trade stocks, [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-an-etf/), or other assets.

How automated investing works?

- An interested investor takes an online survey about their financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals. 
- The automated investing platform then uses this data to recommend investments to the client. 
- Based on the investor’s input, the automated investing platform will recommend and manage a pre-determined portfolio for the investor.
